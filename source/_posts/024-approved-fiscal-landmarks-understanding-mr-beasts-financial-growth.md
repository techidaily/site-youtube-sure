<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Stock Videos:**

Go to the official site of [Filmora video stocks](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/). There are a large number of video templates, stock videos, images, and audio files.

You can also access the stock videos from Pixels, Giphy, Pixabay, and Unsplash without leaving the Filmora Software. Go to the Stock Media section in the top menu to access these.

![filmora stock media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-15.jpg)

**Elements:**

Filmora has an extensive stock of Elements; with the proper use of Elements in YouTube videos, you can make them engaging and interactive. You already know the importance of interactive videos.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The presence of this library reduces the labor of finding images on the internet, makes them accessible to the user, and makes the video interesting.

##### Step7 Export and save the video
