## Part 2: How to Upload 360 Degree Videos to YouTube

It is possible to [add 360 degree videos onto YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631?hl=en). Using YouTube to promote such content is sensible, as it is one of the largest streaming video platforms in the world. These videos can be seen on any of the major browsers and on certain mobile devices. But they must be uploaded from a desktop.

### YouTube 360 Video Specification

The first step of the process is to create a video that YouTube will approve as a 360 submission. Such a video should be either 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, or 60 frames per second. Do not go any higher or it will not be approved.

It is also a good idea to have videos that are between 7168x3584 and 8192x4096 in resolution. Any lower and the quality of the video will not be good enough to provide a pleasant viewing experience to the audience.

### How to Upload to YouTube

Now that you have your video edited, you are a step closer to uploading it onto YouTube. But [there are some steps that you must follow](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/how-to-upload-360-degree-video-to-facebook-youtube-vimeo/). These include downloading the 360 Video Metadata app on your Mac or Windows device.

Then you will choose the file, check the Spherical box and save it. Make sure that **3D top-bottom** is not checked when you save the file. The file should be created in the folder where the original was located. Now you can upload that file to YouTube.
