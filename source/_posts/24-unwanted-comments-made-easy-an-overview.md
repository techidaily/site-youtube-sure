YouTube is a video platform where people share informative and entertaining content. It works in the form of channels belonging to individuals or companies. People can subscribe to these channels to show support, and YouTubers create a strong sense of community with these subscribers.

But some people comment inappropriate comments that can cause the community harm and spread hatred. Many YouTubers may want to delete such remarks. There are also times when you accidentally comment on a channel’s comment section and may wish to delete it.

So how do you delete all YouTube comments? In this how-to blog, we will show you.

To find your History from your desktop, you need to click on the three horizontal lines at the top left corner of the homepage. You will find the History option from the list. To access it from your phone, click on the Library option at the bottom of your homepage, and it will open a list where you will find the History option.

1. Open the video, and scroll down to locate the comment you want to report.
2. Once you find your target comment, click on the three vertical dots that appear on its right side. You will find the Report option from the pop-up menu. Click on that.
