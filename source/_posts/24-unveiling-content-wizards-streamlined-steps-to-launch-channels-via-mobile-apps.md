However, this article may not reveal the different strategies to adopt so you can become an influencer in your line of business; instead, it will start from scratch on how to get your YouTube business page started. How then can one create his own business YouTube account?

**1\. Signing into a Google account**

To successfully start using the YouTube app, there is a need to sign officially into Google. If you've it in mind to have a separate Google account for your business account, you kick-start it at this stage.

However, you can still use your name to open a Google account and create a business YouTube account for subsequent use.

**2\. Creating a business name**

Once you create a Google account, the next step is to make your business a YouTube account. This you do by either signing into your YouTube app or via the YouTube website in your mobile browser. Once logged in to the app interface, you will see the profile photo you used in creating your Google account or the initial letter of the first name you used on the top right-hand side of your mobile. Tap on it, and a drop-down menu will come up, tap on the 'create a channel' icon, which will lead you to another interface where you have the option to select 'Get started' or 'No thanks.' A tap on the get started will reveal an option to either create your channel using the name and image of your Google account or use a customized name.

What are you trying to achieve? Customer education, testimonials or do you want people to subscribe? Be clear on what you want your YouTube channel to do for your brand and how it fits into your overall marketing strategy.

### Gather Content Ideas

Gather content, even before you make a YouTube channel on mobile. You can start with a series of videos talking about your company, products, or industry and then launch the channel once they are all done. If you can't think of any content on your own, try searching around online to see if others have already created videos of this sort and have posted them online. Then, use those videos as examples when you make your content.
