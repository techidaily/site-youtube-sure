1. First, download and install a VPN app.
2. Next, select the USA or India server location to fake a GPS location.
3. Then clear the cache from the YouTube app and click it open.
4. You should now find the option to view and even upload Shorts from your device.

#### Solution 4\. Ensure your video is set as YouTube Shorts

Your video should be set as YouTube Shorts before posting.

1. Identify the video that you wish to post.
2. Add the “#shorts” in your title and description.
3. See that each video is up to 60 seconds only.
4. Post the video and see whether the issue isn’t reoccurring.
