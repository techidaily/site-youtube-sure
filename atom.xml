The ad should also be timely. If you’re looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.</p><h3 id="Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives"><a href="#Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives" class="headerlink" title="Number of clicks each ad receives"></a>Number of clicks each ad receives</h3><p>The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes.

This is the majority of YouTube videos, and just about every one you’ve ever watched will have been public. You’ll want this if you want lots of people to watch your video.</p><p> <strong>Unlisted</strong></p><p> Unlisted videos are ones that anybody can view so long as they have the link. The video won’t show up on search results or in “related” or “suggested” videos.</p><p> This is a great setting for sharing a video amongst small groups. You might have a rough edit you want to show a few people, or you might have a show reel that you only want certain people to see.</p><p> <strong>Private</strong></p><p> Completely private videos cannot be watched by anyone who doesn’t have permission. You grant people permission by allowing their Google accounts to access the video. Nobody else can see the video, regardless of whether they have the link.</p><p> It won’t show up on searches, as related or suggested videos, or even when imbedded in other sites. This is the best setting for a video you need to share with only very specific people, if anyone. Below is a comparison table to know more about <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&hl=en&oco=1" >privacy settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-privacy-setting.JPG"                      alt="youtube privacy setting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Privacy-Settings"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Privacy-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Privacy Settings"></a>Part 2: How to Change Privacy Settings</h2><p> There are two ways to change the privacy settings: firstly, when you upload the video, and secondly through Creator Studio.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p><p> When you upload a video to YouTube you’ll see on the right hand side an option that says “privacy”. This is defaulted to “public”, but you can use the drop-down menu on the button to change the setting. This will apply your privacy setting the second the video finishes uploading and processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-video-privacy.jpg"                      alt="upload youtube video privacy"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p><p> To change the privacy setting later, go to Creator Studio, then Video Manager. On the right-hand side you’ll see one of three icons: a world, a chain, and a lock. The world means <strong>“public”</strong>, the chain means <strong>“unlisted”</strong>, and the lock is for <strong>“private”</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlisted-video.JPG"                      alt="youtube privacy settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134242/18498" target="_top" id="2134242">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134242" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134242/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> To change the privacy, click the icon.

Below where it says “private” on the info and settings page you’ll see a button labeled “share”. Click this and type in the email addresses of the people you want to be able to watch the video. You’ll also have the option of notifying the people via email that you’ve shared the video with them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-private-video.JPG"                      alt="share youtube privacy video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036501/19272" target="_top" id="2036501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036501/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> And that’s all there is to it!

He has done several collab videos and has a lot of advice about how to find potential partners. Here are 3 of his biggest tips:</p><h4 id="1-Approach-people-you-already-have-a-relationship-with"><a href="#1-Approach-people-you-already-have-a-relationship-with" class="headerlink" title="1. Approach people you already have a relationship with"></a>1. Approach people you already have a relationship with</h4><p>This could mean friends, people you have met at events like VidCon, or people who are subscribed to your channel. It is easier for someone to want to collaborate with you if they feel like they know you.</p><h4 id="2-Think-about-what-your-potential-partner-could-have-to-offer-your-existing-subscribers"><a href="#2-Think-about-what-your-potential-partner-could-have-to-offer-your-existing-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="2. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers."></a><strong>2. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers.</strong></h4><p>People sub to Roberto for tech advice, for example, so it makes sense for him to collaborate with people who have insights into technology. Collaborations should never be all about bringing in new subs – make your videos for the people who already watch your channel.</p><h4 id="3-Create-quality-content-consistently"><a href="#3-Create-quality-content-consistently" class="headerlink" title="3. Create quality content consistently."></a><strong>3. Create quality content consistently.</strong></h4><p>If you approach somebody about collaborating and they see that you haven’t posted in over a month, or that you don’t have many videos, it might be harder to get them to agree to work with you. The same goes if they watch your videos and don’t think they are at the same quality level as their videos.</p><h2 id="Tips-From-YouTube-Guru-Nich-Nimmin"><a href="#Tips-From-YouTube-Guru-Nich-Nimmin" class="headerlink" title="Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin"></a>Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin</h2><p>This is a collab video about collab videos! <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCei6wyubYC1I1FwZ54LZFiA" >Nick Nimmin’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> channel is all about YouTube, and Brandon’s channel <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx%5Fiw" >OnePercentBetter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> has tons of cool self-development animations. It’s Brandon giving the tips in this video, and 3 of his best are:</p><h4 id="1-Use-the-person’s-name-when-you-contact-them"><a href="#1-Use-the-person’s-name-when-you-contact-them" class="headerlink" title="1. Use the person’s name when you contact them."></a><strong>1. Use the person’s name when you contact them.</strong></h4><p>This might seem obvious, but it is an easy mistake to make. If you send someone an email where you don’t use their name (maybe you just say ‘hey’) it will seem like you aren’t interested in them. Talking about a video of theirs you like can also help show your interest in them as a creator.</p><h4 id="2-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#2-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep it simple."></a><strong>2. Keep it simple.</strong></h4><p>When you’re approaching someone for the first time, don’t overwhelm them with a long email. Limit yourself to around two paragraphs.</p><h4 id="3-Have-ideas"><a href="#3-Have-ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Have ideas."></a><strong>3. Have ideas.</strong></h4><p>Don’t make your potential partner do the work of pitching ideas to you. Be open to their ideas, but come up with 1 or 2 ideas of your own you can mention when you approach the creator you want to work with. People will be more likely to say ‘yes’ to a specific idea than to the idea of collaborating in general, if they don’t already know you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-From-Freelancer-Lifestyle-Vlogger-Amy-Schmittauer"><a href="#Tips-From-Freelancer-Lifestyle-Vlogger-Amy-Schmittauer" class="headerlink" title="Tips From Freelancer &#x2F; Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer"></a>Tips From Freelancer &#x2F; Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer</h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/savvysexysocial/featured" >Amy Schmittauer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> of Savvy Sexy Social does vlogs, lifestyle videos, and provides tips on being a freelancer. After doing several collabs in one week, she posted this video about how collaborations work best and how you should approach people you might want to work with.</p><h4 id="1-Networking-is-important-in-finding-collab-partners"><a href="#1-Networking-is-important-in-finding-collab-partners" class="headerlink" title="1.

Don’t stray too far from your other content."></a><strong>2. Don’t stray too far from your other content.</strong></h4><p>Aim to make your collab videos similar, content-wise, to the other videos on your channel. That way the new viewers you get from having the guest YouTuber in your video will be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to subscribe to you.</p><h4 id="3-Thank-the-people-you-work-with-in-your-videos"><a href="#3-Thank-the-people-you-work-with-in-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="3.

Thank the people you work with in your videos.</strong></h4><p>If you appeared in someone else’s video, you would probably appreciate it if they thanked you for being there, told their viewers to go check out your channel, and provided a link for them to do so. So, when you host someone else in one of your videos, that’s the kind of treatment you should give them. If you don’t, then the next person you want to collaborate with will see that and probably won’t want to work with you.</p><p> <em>Collab advice starts at around 2:10.</em></p><h2 id="Tips-From-Lifestyle-and-Fashion-YouTuber-MyLifeAsEva"><a href="#Tips-From-Lifestyle-and-Fashion-YouTuber-MyLifeAsEva" class="headerlink" title="Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva"></a>Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva</h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeaseva/featured" >Eva Gutowski <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (MyLifeAsEva) is a lifestyle, fashion, and DIY YouTuber who has done numerous collaborations and believes in making real friends on YouTube.

Don’t approach other YouTubers as a ‘fan’.</strong></h4><p>If you want to be friends and collab partners, talk to other YouTubers as if you are their equal (which you are!). If you want to work with someone it’s probably because you like their videos, and there’s nothing wrong with saying so. Being all ‘omg, I love you, please subscribe to me too!’ isn’t likely to lead to a collab, though.</p><h4 id="2-Ask-questions"><a href="#2-Ask-questions" class="headerlink" title="2.

Ask questions.</strong></h4><p>If you’re just trying to break the ice with someone, it is a good idea to as them a question – potentially about YouTube or one of their videos. This will give them something to engage with, and it’s also a good way to let them know you’re a YouTuber too.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Twitter"><a href="#3-Use-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="3.

It is a form of video marketing that pushes products and services to customers by showing the quality of life associated with a particular brand.</p><p>The principal objective of lifestyle content is appealing to a specific demographic, culture, or subculture. With these videos, you can focus on your products and services, using stunning visuals and action shots to portray a beautiful picture of what your brand’s potential customers’ lives will be like if they become the consumer of your product and services.</p><h2 id="6-Key-Benefits-of-Creating-a-Lifestyle-Video"><a href="#6-Key-Benefits-of-Creating-a-Lifestyle-Video" class="headerlink" title="6 Key Benefits of Creating a Lifestyle Video"></a>6 Key Benefits of Creating a Lifestyle Video</h2><h4 id="1-Informing-Educating"><a href="#1-Informing-Educating" class="headerlink" title="1.

With a plethora of choices out there, marketers today are no longer taking the pitching kind of approach. They want to approach their audience with a value-based offer instead of sales. And with lifestyle videos, you can excel at giving customers a close-up look at your products and services.</p><h4 id="2-Caters-to-Your-Audience’s-Interests"><a href="#2-Caters-to-Your-Audience’s-Interests" class="headerlink" title="2. Caters to Your Audience’s Interests"></a>2. Caters to Your Audience’s Interests</h4><p>Lifestyle content caters to the target audience. Since these videos define your market and your brand, it carries a specific style that’s based on your aesthetics or looks. What makes video marketing so effective is that they can introduce your story and brand in an interesting way to potential customers.</p><h4 id="3-Search-Engine-Optimization"><a href="#3-Search-Engine-Optimization" class="headerlink" title="3.

Using lifestyle videos in your web pages and other types of content can thus work wonders for search engine optimization. As long as your lifestyle video is well-optimized with the right keywords, a solid title, and a good meta description, your video content can increase your web traffic.</p><h4 id="4-Great-Promotional-Tool"><a href="#4-Great-Promotional-Tool" class="headerlink" title="4.

From creative brainstorming to innovative storyboarding, everything happens here. Pre-production begins with experts getting a feel of your product, who it appeals to, and how it works. Next, is the stage of scripting out your video, writing down the visual ideas, and the product features and dialogue that go alongside it. Finally, you need to round up talents like actors, voice-actors, locations, and extras needed to film.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Production"><a href="#Step-2-Production" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Production"></a>Step 2: Production</h4><p>Once your lifestyle video is meticulously planned out, your next step is to film it. While shooting an average video takes eight hours, some videos with several locations can require two full shooting days or more. The exact shooting schedule depends on what the script demands.</p><p>Since these videos are meant to capture a particular way of life for appealing to a specific kind of person, you should not cut corners in terms of quality.

It triggers a pop-up asking them to confirm their subscription. If they were already interested enough to click the link and check out your channel they may confirm the subscription in the window, whereas they may forget to subscribe if they aren’t prompted.</p><p>A YouTube subscribe link is one of the best ways to share a link on your website, in social media posts, or anywhere you mention your channel.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link"></a>How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link</h2><p>YouTube subscribe links aren’t some kind of exclusive perk – anyone can have one!</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your YouTube channel page and click into the address bar so you can edit the URL.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following to the end of your channel URL:</p><p>?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy the entire URL including the part you added and paste it into a word document to save. Any time you share a link to your channel, make sure it is this link.</p><p>This will work both with channels that have custom URLs and channels which do not. Here’s an example:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>That’s a link for Wondershare Filmora Video Editor’s YouTube channel. With the modifier it looks like this:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub%5C_confirmation=1" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub\_confirmation=1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>Getting subscribers is tough, but you’ll get more if you ask and this is just another way of asking. The process for creating a YouTube subscribe link is easy and accessible to everyone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082520/7443" target="_top" id="2082520">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082520" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082520/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Touch-Up-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Touch-Up-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features lots of video and audio editing tools that enables you to cut, trim and touch up the video clip easily.

YouTube gamers are among some of the most popular vloggers on YouTube. To be a successful YouTube gamer you need have both gaming skills and a great vlogging presence.</p><p>Posting a cool gaming videos once in a while for your friends is fun, and if that is all you want to do then the first tip on this list should help you out. If you are hoping to build a popular YouTube channel centered on gaming then you will want to read further. Gaming vlogs are more than just hobbies for successful YouTube gamers. They put a lot of work into them.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about being a gaming vlogger is that gameplay footage is protected by copyright. Some game creators will allow for the use of this footage in gaming vlogs because it helps promote their games, but others see these videos as competition for their games. There will usually be information on the manufacturer’s website, often in the ‘Terms of Use’ section, which explains their policy. If you have questions about it, or want permission to use footage from a game you are not allowed to, you should ask. There are YouTube gamers posting videos of games the copyright does not allow them to who have gotten special permission, although this is more likely to be given if your channel is already popular.</p><hr><p>Looking for a good video editor for your gaming video? Wondershare Filmora is recommended. It is not just a video editor which allows you to cut, split, add text, apply background sound to your video clips, but also a screen recorder which helps you record videos from PC screem webcam, and voice over. What’s more, you can find lots of special effects for gaming in this software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><p>&lt;2&gt; Four tips for YouTube gamers:</p><h4 id="1-Equipment"><a href="#1-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="1. Equipment"></a>1. Equipment</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gamer-elgato.JPG"                      alt="gamer elgato"                ></p><p>For some types of vlogs, beauty vlogs for example, the camera is the most important piece of equipment. For a YouTube gamer the most important piece of equipment is a game recorder, such as the Elgato Game Capture featured above. The Elgato Game Capture costs about $150 online, which is a typical price for a quality game recorder. Most of the footage you record is going to be from inside your games, so a game recorder is a must. Nobody wants to watch footage recorded from a camera pointing at your tv screen.</p><p>You will need a camera if you want to record reaction videos, which you probably will if you are going to be playing horror games where your reactions enhance the viewing experience. You do not need to record a reaction video for every game you play, though. So, it is not necessary for you to pay upwards of $1000 on a DSLR for your gaming channel. A good webcam will do, or you could even use your phone’s camera.</p><p>Aside from your game play the most important thing you will be recording is audio. It is worth investing in an external microphone. Since you do not need to worry about the range of your microphone for a gaming vlog something like the Blue Snowball USB mic is a great choice. These cost about $50 online. LAV mics are also popular among vloggers because they can be clipped onto your shirt while you record. An entire Lavalier system can cost over $100, sometimes around $600, but it is less expensive to buy a single LAV mic that plugs into the audio jack of your phone or computer.</p><p>If you cannot afford to invest in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >an external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you should download a free audio editing program called Audacity from <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacityteam.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use Audacity to improve the quality of the sound you record using your computer or camera.</p><h4 id="2-Developing-Your-Voice"><a href="#2-Developing-Your-Voice" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Your Voice"></a>2. Developing Your Voice</h4><p>The reason a lot of people will want to watch your gaming videos while they could be watching someone else’s is not because you are a great gamer. It is because you are a great entertainer. Your vlogging voice should be a lot like a DJ’s radio voice; clear, confident, and louder than you would ever be at the dinner table. People do not tend to actually talk in the same voice they vlog in and YouTube gamers are no exception.</p><p>Forcing yourself into a fake voice is awkward, though, and while your vlogging voice is something you will need to develop it should not be fake. Remember to speak up and focus on your games. Some of your best commentary will happen while you are completely absorbed in what you are doing. Talking while you game and sounding natural will not happen right away, but it will with practice. When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p><h4 id="3-Time-Management"><a href="#3-Time-Management" class="headerlink" title="3. Time Management"></a>3. Time Management</h4><p>Recording a gaming video you are happy with takes time. Editing that video can also take up a lot of time, depending on the style of video you want to post. These are the time commitments that most people expect to have when starting a gaming channel, but they are not the only ones.</p><p>Initially, you will need to spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of gaming channel you want to run. Are you more focused on game reviews, or on comedy? You will also need to consider whether your target audience consists of serious gamers who are looking for something informative or casual gamers – perhaps even non-gamers – who just want to watch entertaining YouTube videos. The answers to these questions will lead you to building your brand, which can also be time consuming. You will need channel art – like an icon and a banner – as well as intro and outro sequences. Plan to think about and create these things early or you will end up getting busy and rushing through them.</p><p>The other things related to your gaming channel which will be taking up your time are: researching gaming trends, networking with other YouTube gamers, and promoting your channel. You need to plan out times for these activities, as well as time limits. These are the things that can eat up all of your personal time if you let them.</p><h4 id="4-Channel-Promotion"><a href="#4-Channel-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="4. Channel Promotion"></a>4. Channel Promotion</h4><p>In order to start getting more views and subscribers you will need to promote your channel. Part of this is having searchable video titles and descriptions, but you also need to get involved with the communities surrounding the games you are playing. These communities are more likely to want to watch your videos if you are a part of them.</p><p>Besides creating your own gaming videos you will need to watch other people’s and reach out to these gamers through comments. If you find another YouTube gamer with close to your same number of subscribers then you may even want to approach them about collaboration. This is one way you can promote your channel; by introducing yourself to the other gamer’s subscribers and allowing them to be introduced to yours. You will also need to put time into being active in gaming forums and communities in order to show people you know what you are doing and tell them about your channel.</p><p>You should not use the comments sections of other people’s videos, or gaming forums, just to promote your own channel. You can and should promote your channel through these mediums, it just cannot seem like self-interest is the only reason you are bothering. When you comment on another gamer’s video actually say something that gamer might want to respond to, not just ‘I did a video like this too, check it out!’. It is the same when you start getting involved with gaming forums. You need to participate in conversations and take an interest in people if you want them to take an interest in you and your work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/onts-that-make-a-difference-your-20-best-choices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Fonts That Make a Difference Your 20 Best Choices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-watch-facebook-videos-on-my-apple-tv/"><u>[New] How to Watch Facebook Videos on My Apple TV?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/he-ultimate-guide-to-cinematography-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Cinematography on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-top-8-free-video-calling-applications-recommended-for-businesses-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top 8 Free Video Calling Applications Recommended for Businesses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-how-to-assemble-a-personalized-youtube-music-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Assemble a Personalized YouTube Music List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-skyrocket-to-your-youtube-audience-goal-1kplus/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Skyrocket to Your YouTube Audience Goal 1K+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/approved-enrich-viewers-experience-a-comprehensive-guide-to-youtube-end-screens/"><u>2024 Approved Enrich Viewers' Experience A Comprehensive Guide to Youtube End Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/inners-guide-to-seo-skyrocket-your-view-count-for-2024/"><u>A Beginner’s Guide to SEO Skyrocket Your View Count for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/balancing-ai-realism-six-key-cues-for-authentic-respitsonses/"><u>Balancing AI Realism: Six Key Cues for Authentic Respitsonses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/lating-your-digital-footprint-understanding-views-and-income-from-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Calculating Your Digital Footprint Understanding Views & Income From YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/clearing-the-path-eradicating-e52-anomaly/"><u>Clearing the Path: Eradicating E52 Anomaly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-news.techidaily.com/cookiebot-driven-custom-user-experience-optimization/"><u>Cookiebot-Driven Custom User Experience Optimization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/phone-videos-to-channel-fame-an-easy-path-for-new-entrepreneurs-for-2024/"><u>From Phone Videos to Channel Fame An Easy Path for New Entrepreneurs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-most-effective-methods-to-unlock-apple-iphone-11-in-lost-mode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 11 in Lost Mode | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-find-unlocking-codes-for-nokia-c32-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Nokia C32 Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/quick-voice-fixes-for-your-snapchat-snaps-using-dual-methods-for-2024/"><u>Quick Voice Fixes for Your Snapchat Snaps Using Dual Methods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/utionize-your-channels-thumbnails-with-these-tools-for-2024/"><u>Revolutionize Your Channel's Thumbnails with These Tools for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1542129">                    <video width="864" height="1152" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1542129">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"                      style="border: none;

The keywords should also be relevant to your video.</p><h4 id="Video-Description"><a href="#Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="Video Description"></a>Video Description</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description"                ></p><p>When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers.

Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.</p><p>Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.</p><p>What’s more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Watch-Time"><a href="#Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="Watch Time"></a>Watch Time</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time"                ></p><p>Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.</p><p>YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly</p><p>Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.</p><h4 id="Thumbnails"><a href="#Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails"></a>Thumbnails</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails"                ></p><p>Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views"><a href="#Number-of-Views" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.</p><h4 id="Using-Video-Hashtags"><a href="#Using-Video-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Using Video Hashtags"></a>Using Video Hashtags</h4><p>Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging.

Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title.

Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.</p><p>Video titles should have five words or less. Don’t forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title.

With that in mind, here are some factors that affect your YouTube ranking.</p><h4 id="Video-Title-3"><a href="#Video-Title-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Title"></a>Video Title</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-1.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815679/21290" target="_top" id="1815679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815679/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>YouTube videos number in the many millions. Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.</p><p>On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.</p><p>A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views. Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.</p><p>Video titles should have five words or less. Don’t forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title. The keywords should also be relevant to your video.</p><h4 id="Video-Description-3"><a href="#Video-Description-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Description"></a>Video Description</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description"                ></p><p>When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers. Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.</p><p>Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won’t know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.</p><p>Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.</p><p>When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.</p><h4 id="Video-Quality-3"><a href="#Video-Quality-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality"></a>Video Quality</h4><p>Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill. Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.</p><p>Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.</p><p>What’s more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Watch-Time-3"><a href="#Watch-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="Watch Time"></a>Watch Time</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139115/17108" target="_top" id="2139115">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139115" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139115/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.</p><p>YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly</p><p>Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.</p><h4 id="Thumbnails-3"><a href="#Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails"></a>Thumbnails</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304648">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304648">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304648%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304648/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views-3"><a href="#Number-of-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking-3"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement-3"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.</p><h4 id="Using-Video-Hashtags-3"><a href="#Using-Video-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Video Hashtags"></a>Using Video Hashtags</h4><p>Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video-3"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging.

Former PayPal employees Chad Hurley, Steven Chen and Jawed Karim founded YouTube in 2005 and only a year later their platform was one of the world’s fastest growing websites, surpassing MySpace with more than 100 million video views in the July of the same year. It wasn’t long before YouTube was purchased by Google on November 13. 2006 and since then the world’s most popular video sharing platform has grown continuously.</p><p>In 2017, more than 500 hours of video content are being uploaded to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> each minute, and over 1.5 billion active users utilize it to share their memories, music they love, business ideas or anything else they feel strongly about. The following infographic will present some of the most interesting YouTube facts and statistics that will enable you to understand better one of the most popular websites ever created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/mind-blowing-youtube-stats-facts-2017.jpg"                      alt="mind blowing youtube stats facts 2017"                ></p><p>It’s hard to pick highlights from such an interesting and comprehensive read, but a couple of key stats shine out.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube has just 0,5 billion users less than Facebook</strong></li></ul><p>Mark Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the best-known business geniuses who made his fortune by creating the social network everyone wanted to be a part of. With more than 2 billion active users Facebook is the largest online community on the Internet today. YouTube has 1.5 billion active monthly users which makes it the second largest platform of its kind, well ahead of Instagram, LinkedIn or Twitter.</p><ul><li><strong>People aged 24 to 44 watch the most videos on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>This information isn’t particularly surprising since younger generations use the Internet more frequently than the older ones. 49% of all YouTube users are aged between 24 and 44, but this statistic will likely change in the future since YouTube’s popularity can only increase. What comes in as a surprise is the fact that men spend 24% more time on YouTube than women. Could it be that men are more interested in music, short videos or promotional business videos than women or perhaps, women are simply more practical and thus tend to spend less time aimlessly going through endless video content.</p><ul><li><strong>9% of the videos are taken down because of the copyright infringements</strong></li></ul><p>At one point in the early 2000’s, it seemed as if the copyright laws will be changed forever by the Internet. Since then countless initiatives have prevented YouTube users to view, upload or share content that they don’t have the permission to use. In 2017, 9% of all videos uploaded on YouTube are taken down by the copyright holders. This means that YouTubers must make sure that all content they upload is unique or that they at least have a permission to use it.</p><ul><li><strong>An average person spends 40 minutes on YouTube each day</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube is probably one of the best pastimes the Internet can offer, and for that reason, a common person spends 40 minutes on YouTube per day. When you add an average life expectancy into the equation the math shows that during their lifetimes, people spend nearly 2 years on YouTube, or 1 year and 10 months to be exact.</p><ul><li><strong>Pop music singers are the most popular celebrities on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>Naturally, music is the most searched term on YouTube, and celebrities like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry or Rihana have millions of subscribers with billions of total video views. Unlike Facebook where the most popular celebrities are Christiano Ronaldo or Vin Diesel, an actor and a football player, YouTube stars are mostly musicians and Pop Culture icons whose music is available to fans across the globe because of this platform. Some of the historically most viewed videos on YouTube are Luis Fonsi’s Despacito, Psy’s Gangnam Style or Tayler Swift’s Shake it Off that all have a staggering amount of views.</p><p>Let us know what you think about these interesting facts about YouTube in the comments below and feel free to share this article with your friends and colleagues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-synergizing-visual-cues-with-the-right-musical-choices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Synergizing Visual Cues with the Right Musical Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ros-insight-top-8-online-repositories-for-free-green-screen-scenery/"><u>[New] Pros' Insight Top 8 Online Repositories for Free Green Screen Scenery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-top-10-hidden-strategies-in-canvas-image-design-toolkit/"><u>[New] Top 10 Hidden Strategies in Canva's Image Design Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-approaches-to-clearer-zoomed-video-on-online-platforms/"><u>[New] Ultimate Approaches to Clearer Zoomed Video on Online Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-kickstart-your-youtube-journey-with-the-best-tools/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Kickstart Your YouTube Journey with the Best Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-discover-the-top-3-alternative-video-portals-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discover the Top 3 Alternative Video Portals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-top-5-multimedia-sensation-apps-iphoneandroid-showdown/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 5 Multimedia Sensation Apps IPhone/Android Showdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ive-channel-themes-get-them-for-free-for-2024/"><u>Creative Channel Themes Get Them for Free for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-find-my-iphone-without-apple-id-on-your-iphone-15-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Remove Find My iPhone without Apple ID On your iPhone 15?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-conquer-youtube-creator-studio-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>In 2024, Conquer YouTube Creator Studio A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-filmmaking-mastery-youtube-trailer-design-with-filmora/"><u>In 2024, Filmmaking Mastery YouTube Trailer Design with Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-premium-panzoid-structure-packs/"><u>In 2024, Premium Panzoid Structure Packs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-revolutionize-your-branding-50-free-youtube-banners-inside/"><u>In 2024, Revolutionize Your Branding - 50 Free YouTube Banners Inside!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-samsung-galaxy-f04-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Samsung Galaxy F04 Phones</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082536/7443" target="_top" id="2082536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082536/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions.

This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color.

This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production. To prevent shadow interference, the green screen should be smooth, tense, and without wrinkles or shadows.</p><p>High-quality cameras are essential every time, especially for chroma keying. Images with better definition are easier to key, so camera quality significantly affects the outcome. Even if your camera isn’t the best, merely shooting well can ensure a clean color-keying process during editing, resulting in professional-looking visuals.</p><h2 id="Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key"><a href="#Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key" class="headerlink" title="Recording Tips for Chroma Key"></a>Recording Tips for Chroma Key</h2><ul><li>Proper Lighting</li></ul><p>Maintaining uniform and well-defined lighting during recording is essential for a successful chroma-keying process. This consistency ensures a seamless keying process during post-production.</p><ul><li>Keep Distance from the Green Screen</li></ul><p>The optimal distance between the subject and the green screen minimizes color spill and allows for natural movements. Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues. Subjects also have to be positioned in such a way that there is minimal light interference and reflection. These contribute to a flawless chroma key outcome.</p><h2 id="3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies"><a href="#3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies"></a>3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies</h2><ul><li>Color Spill</li></ul><p>Sometimes, reflected light from your green background can be cast on your subject and may remain so when the background light is keyed out. This phenomenon is known as a color spill. It is usually because of uneven lighting or shooting around reflecting surfaces. Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly. Due to the translucency of hair, it is common for some unintended light to seep through. This allows some background visibility, which you do not want with a chroma key. This is especially notable with lighter hair colors like blond hair.</p><p>There are ways to account for this. Many video-editing software have features such as spill suppression and screen matte adjustments that can enhance the final footage. Specialized plugins also go a long way in ensuring minimizing spill. Addressing spill correction tackles unwanted green artifacts and ensures a clean keying process.</p><ul><li>Poor Lighting</li></ul><p>Suboptimal green screen lighting can lead to inconsistencies in keying and editing, undermining your product. One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste.

YouTube is the world’s biggest video sharing platform that already allows its users to stream live videos through third-party applications such as Wirecast Play or OBS. Less than a month ago, YouTube has finally made possible live streaming directly from a computer’s webcam. The option is currently only available on Chrome browsers, but the company claims that more browsers will start offering this feature soon.</p><p>In this article, we are going to provide you with all the information you’ll need to create seamless live streams using a webcam and introduce you to some of the best webcam models in 2021.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021"><a href="#Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021"></a>Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021</h2><p>The quality of the video recording you intend to broadcast live is essential for the success of your live streams. Most built-in laptop webcams produce low-quality videos, and for that reason using an external webcam that captures high-resolution videos can help you create live streams that attract a lot of attention from YouTube’s community.</p><h3 id="How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?"></a>How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?</h3><p><strong>Compatability:</strong> Even the best webcams on the market are completely useless if they are not compatible with your computer. Finding a webcam that works with a PC or a Mac shouldn’t be too difficult because both Windows and iOS platforms offer support for a wide range of models.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> YouTubers that just want to produce simple live streams don’t have to pay a lot of attention to the video resolution, because their videos don’t show too many details. Vloggers and gamers, on the other hand, should consider using webcams that produce 4K or HD footage since lower-priced options have a hard time realistically depicting colors. The quality of the video output a webcam produces can increase its price significantly, so there’s no reason investing in it if you don’t have the intention of utilizing its features to the fullest.</p><p><strong>Sound Quality:</strong> Besides the video features, you should also look into the webcam’s audio options, because no one wants to watch a video with a terrible sound. Buying an external microphone is probably the best solution to this issue, but if you can’t afford one, then purchasing a webcam with decent audio recording features is the second best option.</p><p><strong>Adjustable Location:</strong> Although the angle from which you are recording a stream may not seem important, poorly framed live streams are more likely to go unnoticed. A webcam that is easily adjustable can grant you the freedom of choosing your shots on every live stream you share online and it will enable you to control each and every detail in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137222/26400" target="_top" id="2137222">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137222" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137222/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Best-Webcams-for-YouTube-Live-streaming-in-2021"><a href="#4-Best-Webcams-for-YouTube-Live-streaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="4 Best Webcams for YouTube Live streaming in 2021"></a>4 Best Webcams for YouTube Live streaming in 2021</h3><p>There are thousands of different webcams you can use to record a live stream, but the models featured below are some of the very best currently available on the market.</p><h4 id="1-Logitech-4K-Pro-webcam"><a href="#1-Logitech-4K-Pro-webcam" class="headerlink" title="1.
