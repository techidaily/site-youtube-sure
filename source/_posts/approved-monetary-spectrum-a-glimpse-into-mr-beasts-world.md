**Transition:**

Transition smoothens the video, especially when various clips are combined. Use transitions from the Filmora Transition section and set the stage for the next scene, convey the mood and smoothen your YouTube video.

![filmora transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-17.jpg)

The presence of this library reduces the labor of finding images on the internet, makes them accessible to the user, and makes the video interesting.
