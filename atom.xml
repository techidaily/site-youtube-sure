Can someone tell me how to work on a sports video?”</em></p><p>As I read this query posted on a popular online forum, I realized that so many people out there find it hard to create a sports video. Well, unlike a standard video, working on a sports highlight video can be tough. This is because it needs a lot of editing and we need to handpick the right moments from hours of footage. Though, if you use the right tools, then you can easily work on highlight videos like a pro. In this guide, I will let you know how to create sports videos in a step by step manner.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Highlight Video vs. Skills Video</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Create a Sports Highlight Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important"><a href="#Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is a sports highlight video and why important?"></a>Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</h2><p>As the name suggests, a highlight video basically includes all the vital events of a game in a short duration of time. You can include the details of some players at the start or focus on a particular player as well. Besides that, a sports highlight video would have fast-forward, slow motion, and frozen clips to skip or focus on certain details.</p><p>A lot of times, people don’t have the time to watch the entire game, which can span for a couple of hours. Therefore, they can watch a sports highlight video that would include all the major events of the game and will let them enjoy their thrill in a few moments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sports-highlight-video.jpg"                      alt="Sports Highlight Video"                ></p><p>Besides that, if you are applying for a college&#x2F;academy or just want to showcase your skills, then you can consider making a sports video of an impressive game of yours. You can simply showcase a player and try to highlight their skills in the video.</p><h2 id="Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences"><a href="#Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences"></a>Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences</h2><p>While making a sports video, you might encounter two different types of content – a highlight video and a skills video. As I have mentioned above, a sports highlight video would include the shots of an actual game. You can either focus on the event of a single game or include clips from multiple games that were played in a genuine setup. If you want, you can highlight a particular player while making the video as well.</p><p>On the other hand, a skills video is mostly made to demonstrate the skills of a player and is not focused on the game. In fact, most of the skills videos are made outside of a real game setting. For instance, if you have mastered a skill or would like to demonstrate your game-related actions, then you can make a skills video. Some of these videos are also tutorial game-plays to teach others about a particular skill that they can master.</p><h2 id="Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video"><a href="#Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video" class="headerlink" title="Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video"></a>Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</h2><p>If you want to come up with engaging and visually appealing highlight videos, then consider using a versatile video editor like <strong>Filmora</strong>. Equipped with several video editing tools, it will let you create a sports highlight video in no time. Since the tool has so many features, you can save your time in editing and come up with a new sports video in minutes.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><ul><li>Filmora is extremely easy to use and runs on all the leading Windows and macOS versions without any issue.</li><li>Using its inbuilt tools, you can clip out the most important events from a sports video or include them in your highlights.</li><li>There are also features to change the motion and pace of the video (like fast forward or slow motion).</li><li>You can also focus on any athlete and freeze a frame on a particular skill or action.</li><li>Besides that, you can also add voiceovers in your sports highlight video, add media layers, use its inbuilt transitions, and fine-tune the overall aesthetics of your videos.</li><li>There are also tons of filters and presets in Filmora that you can use to save your time in editing.

Firstly, you can install Filmora on your Windows or Mac by visiting its website and have the footage you wish to edit. Now, you can just follow these steps to work on your next sports highlight video.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="Step-1-Add-a-video-to-Filmora"><a href="#Step-1-Add-a-video-to-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Add a video to Filmora"></a>Step 1: Add a video to Filmora</h4><p>To start with, just launch Filmora on your computer and add the video that you wish to work on. You can just drag and drop the video to its interface or go to its Menu &gt; File &gt; Import Media to browse and load the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Import Media File"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-the-Sports-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-the-Sports-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit the Sports Video"></a>Step 2: Edit the Sports Video</h4><p>In order to create a sports highlight video, the first thing that people do is trim any unwanted part. Once the video is loaded, you can view it on the timeline of the interface. Now, go to the timeline and get the trim tool to manually select the part of the video you wish to trim. After selecting the desired fragment, you can trim the clip or just delete it by clicking on their respective icons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-1.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><p>In the same way, you can also split your video and make other changes in it. You can also include multiple videos together and include them in your timeline as well.</p><p>If you are including multiple videos, then make sure they have the same dimensions and aspect ratio. For this, you can select the video, right-click on the timeline, and click on the crop icon. Now, select the same aspect ratio for the entire video to keep it uniform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-2.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><p>Most of the game highlights that we see have different speeds for various sections. That is, some actions would be fast-forwarded while some would be in slow motion. To apply this, simply select the section in the timeline, right-click, and go to the Speed and Duration settings. This will open a dedicated interface from where you can change the speed of the sports video.</p><p>Apart from manually setting the speed, you can also take the assistance of the custom speed options that are available in the timeline tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-3.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Make-Advanced-Edits-in-your-Sports-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Make-Advanced-Edits-in-your-Sports-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Make Advanced Edits in your Sports Video"></a>Step 3: Make Advanced Edits in your Sports Video</h4><p>With the user-friendly interface of Filmora, you can do some basic edits and make a sports highlight video in minutes. Though, if you want to focus on some parts and make more changes, then you can use its advanced options as well.</p><p>For instance, in a highlight video, we often wish to freeze certain frames. To do this, just select a frame and use the “Freeze Frame” option from the timeline tools. You can even set the duration to freeze the selected frame.</p><p>If you have included clips from different videos, then you can apply all kinds of transitions from Filmora. In the end, you can go to its edit options and choose to close gaps as well.</p><p>To give your video a uniform and aesthetically pleasing appeal, you can also add different overlays and effects on it from Filmora’s library.</p><p>Lastly, make sure that you added sound or voiceover to your video. You can add a sound from its library or import any other music file to it. Since highlight videos mostly have voiceovers, you add the same by visiting the Record &gt; Record Voiceover option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-4.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Export-your-video-in-the-desired-format"><a href="#Step-4-Export-your-video-in-the-desired-format" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Export your video in the desired format"></a>Step 4: Export your video in the desired format</h4><p>That’s it! Once your sports highlight video is ready, you can export it in different formats. Just go to the Export option and select the location to save the video and a preferred resolution. You can save your video in formats like MP4, WMV, AVI, FLV, MKV, and so on.</p><h2 id="Expert-Tips-for-Creating-Highlight-Videos"><a href="#Expert-Tips-for-Creating-Highlight-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos"></a>Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos</h2><p>As you can see, making a sports highlight video with a tool like Filmora is extremely easy. Although to be a pro and make better videos, you can consider the following tips:</p><h4 id="Keep-it-short"><a href="#Keep-it-short" class="headerlink" title="Keep it short"></a>Keep it short</h4><p>Make sure that you only include the highlights of the game in your video to keep it interesting. Your aim is to have a short and crisp video without any unwanted footage.</p><h4 id="Use-freeze-frames-and-slow-motion"><a href="#Use-freeze-frames-and-slow-motion" class="headerlink" title="Use freeze frames and slow motion"></a>Use freeze frames and slow motion</h4><p>Some games can be pretty fast-paced and the viewers might miss out on a few key details. To showcase them, you can freeze certain frames or apply slow motion.</p><h4 id="Include-other-details"><a href="#Include-other-details" class="headerlink" title="Include other details"></a>Include other details</h4><p>A sports highlight video can also be informative. You can include details about the players or the team at the start. Also, it is recommended to have sound or a voiceover in the background to narrate the events.</p><h4 id="Pick-the-best-clips"><a href="#Pick-the-best-clips" class="headerlink" title="Pick the best clips"></a>Pick the best clips</h4><p>When you watch a game, make a note of the best moments that you know your viewers would enjoy. You can also focus on different skills that you found impressive and include them in your sports video.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to come up with an impressive sports highlight video as well. Since you might need to make a lot of edits on a sports video, I would recommend using a diverse tool like Filmora. With the tons of editing options that it provides, you can easily create all sorts of highlight videos while saving your time and resources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-expert-advice-on-crafting-effective-youtube-video-tags/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Expert Advice on Crafting Effective YouTube Video Tags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-branding-excellence-integrating-watermarks-and-logos-into-video-media/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Branding Excellence  Integrating Watermarks and Logos Into Video Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-2024-a-new-era-for-elite-camera-technology/"><u>[Updated] 2024  A New Era for Elite Camera Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-dialogue-and-direction-in-film-scripts/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Dialogue and Direction in Film Scripts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-open-source-options-is-vlc-bound-to-beat-mpc/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring Open-Source Options  Is VLC Bound to Beat MPC?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-you-should-know-about-speech-to-text-technology/"><u>In 2024, What You Should Know About Speech-to-Text Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-template-transformations-build-unique-logos-for-pennies/"><u>[New] In 2024, Template Transformations  Build Unique Logos for Pennies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-convert-photo-to-cartoon-style/"><u>2024 Approved Convert Photo to Cartoon Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-screen-mirroring-motorola-moto-g34-5g-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Screen Mirroring Motorola Moto G34 5G to PC?

So if you are a cooking aficionado, you have excellent potential to gain positive attention and a loyal audience. But to create engaging videos, you’d need a lot more than excellent culinary skills. This article aims to enlighten aspiring food and recipe vloggers about the essentials of video making straight out of the oven, to create enriched content that’s professional, neat, and viral-worthy.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Tips to Make Your Cooking Videos Stand Out</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Promote Your Cooking Channel on YouTube?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-to-Prepare-Before-Making-a-Recipe-Video"><a href="#What-to-Prepare-Before-Making-a-Recipe-Video" class="headerlink" title="What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video"></a>What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video</h2><p>While you would know best about the prep work needed for the recipes, the prep work for making a video starts with a plan. What goes into the plan?</p><p>Brainstorm this equation - <strong>Main Content + Duration + Light + Sound + Camera + Camera Angle, Shots &amp; Transition</strong>.</p><p><strong>The main content is how you picture the finished video</strong>. Ask yourself - Do you want an intro gig? Are you going to talk in the video or show only hands and the cooking with a piece of background music? How do you wish to present the ingredients? Would there be additional tips? At what platform are you going to publish your content? How long should be your clippings? Consider all these questions to chalk out a basic framework of your video</p><p><strong>The camera is a pivotal element</strong>. Whether it is a smartphone or a hi-fidelity digital camera, it is worthwhile to familiarise the best positions and light orientations and the capacity of the device to produce the best quality picture.</p><p><strong>How is your sound going to be like?</strong> If you are going to talk in the video, it is recommended that you use a microphone. Or else, you can also use background sound. But to mix sound with the video, you’d need an excellent sound editing tool.</p><p>Finally, comes the editing and finishing part. Eventually, you’ll need purposive video-editing software to help you work out the video transitions, sound, and visual effects.<strong>Choose a toolkit that is easy to learn</strong> and that you can get comfortable with so that the job of video editing doesn’t take the focus away from the main task of cooking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recipe-videos.jpg"                      alt="Recipe Videos"                ></p><p>Now, once you have all the essential ingredients to create your video, start practicing. Remember that it is the most natural thing for the first videos to appear amateurish or inept. And that is part of the plan. Don’t be disheartened and keep going.</p><h2 id="Make-a-Cooking-Video-with-Filmora-a-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Make-a-Cooking-Video-with-Filmora-a-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>As one of the easiest-to-use video editing tools, the full-featured Filmora is the right choice considering it can fit most of your needs. Moreover, you’d be delighted to know that the software also has a series of features and functions and even tutorial videos dedicated to cooking videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Step-1-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Step-1-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Filming the Video"></a>Step 1: Filming the Video</h4><p>Whether you are going to present a traditional cook-with-me style video or feature the contemporary “jump-cut” style focusing on speedy short videos, you need to prepare all the equipment and ingredients to suit the frame by frame shots. Consider spills, drops, overcooking, etc. as part of the process, so keep adequate substitutes to continue with your project unwaveringly. If you are using a phone, keep it fully charged up. And have a plan beforehand about what you should do when you get an urgent call while shooting. Also, consider doing a site investigation of the shooting spot for any fragile items, pointy corners, slippery areas, curious pets, etc. to avoid trips and falls in the middle of the filming, especially when working with a cameraman who’s following your movement. If you are using a tripod, and floor-standing lights, remember to secure the equipment with plenty of adhesive tapes, lest they bump into an expensive trip or fall.</p><h4 id="Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora"><a href="#Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora"></a>Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora</h4><p>You need to sync the device that you used to film the video with the computer that has Filmora installed. It may be a phone or a camcorder. Once the devices are synced, you should launch the Filmora software and go the <strong>“Media”</strong> button at the top right toolbar. There you will find the <strong>“Import”</strong> button. You will get a pop-up message asking you to choose the type of device. Select the right one, and your video will be imported in the Filmora interface.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion"></a>Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion</h4><p>To create crisp, fast-paced videos, you don’t have to gobble up the content eyeing at the duration. Think smart when you have the resources of a tool like Filmora. Here are the three best features that help you create fast-paced yet well-defined recipes.</p><p><strong>Time-Lapse:</strong> The time-lapse feature allows you to adjust the speed of the video from slow-motion to 10x faster. To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want. You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing). To make this look neat, preview the portion of the clip once again and delete the cuts between two clips with the same right-click.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora"><a href="#Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora"></a>Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora</h4><p>Transitions make your video more interactive and help you segregate the video from frame-to-frame with effects like dissolve, fade, flash, etc. there are numerous transition options available within the Filmora suit.</p><p>The best way to do this drag and drop the clips on the timeline is to trim parts of the clip to shorten it. Once you have all the clips in place, go to the <strong>“Transitions”</strong> options at the top toolbar to apply it on the end or start of each clip.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits"><a href="#Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits"></a>Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits</h4><p>There are plenty of options that you can remove background noise, add voiceover, add music, and detach audio from video. Refer to the Audios section from your toolbar.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Save-to-Drive-Emport-Publish"><a href="#Step-6-Save-to-Drive-Emport-Publish" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Save to Drive&#x2F; Emport&#x2F; Publish"></a>Step 6: Save to Drive&#x2F; Emport&#x2F; Publish</h4><p>Once you are satisfied with your content, then go to Export. Choose the format of the video, MOV, MP4, MPG, etc. and whether you wish to publish directly or save to drive.</p><h2 id="Tips-to-Make-Your-Cooking-Videos-Stand-Out"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Your-Cooking-Videos-Stand-Out" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Your Cooking Videos Stand Out"></a>Tips to Make Your Cooking Videos Stand Out</h2><ul><li>Lighting is your best friend. Invest in some quality spotlights or use the best of daylight.</li><li>Mind your video duration. Short and Simple videos get the most views, but your content should not look incomplete. It is not a fact that long and elaborate videos do not get a place on the table; it is all about the relevance of your content. So don’t stop till you get enough.</li><li>If you appear in the video, keep yourself always look good.</li><li>Keep your video titles relevant and prominent, so that people looking for it can readily find it.</li><li>Have a scrumptious custom thumbnail.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Promote-Your-Cooking-Channel-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Promote-Your-Cooking-Channel-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Promote Your Cooking Channel on YouTube"></a>How to Promote Your Cooking Channel on YouTube</h2><ul><li>Create an inventory before publishing videos. YouTube vlogging is valued for consistency. If you have a list of 10, 15, 20 videos, then you can have enough time in hand to film your next videos.</li><li>Have a consistent style to create brand recognition. Do you think branding is not for Vlogs? Well, I suppose you might be wrong.

Unless you garner deep insights of your competitors. You must be thinking how can you gauge their company insights using YouTube and track the data movement as well. There is nothing to worry about, we have got you covered. We will show you how to analyze your own channel as well as that of your competitors’ YouTube analytics. Let’s now explore about it!</p><h2 id="How-to-analyze-your-own-YouTube-channel-video"><a href="#How-to-analyze-your-own-YouTube-channel-video" class="headerlink" title="How to analyze your own YouTube channel&#x2F;video?"></a>How to analyze your own YouTube channel&#x2F;video?</h2><p> It is important to have reliable YouTube analytics tools for your brand, as videos on YouTube are searchable through Google. They contribute to generate organic traffic for you using both Google and YouTube as a medium. YouTube has a default dedicated analytics mechanism to measure how the video fares in YouTube to gain the most out of it.</p><p> Here we have collated the broadly used YouTube insights to ensure that your highly equipped, SEO compatible video engages more audience and performs well. The matrix sums up the most essential parts of YouTube analytics. Let’s go through them.</p><h4 id="1-Views"><a href="#1-Views" class="headerlink" title="1.  Views"></a>1.  Views</h4><p> Though, views determine the number of people clicked on a certain video on YouTube, it’s impossible to figure out whether the video has been watched till the end or not. Moreover, they can be altered through clickbait tricks and hence YouTube doesn’t solely put much value on them.</p><p> Views along with watch time turn out to be the best bet. Watch time sums up the total amount of time spent (in terms of minutes) on your brand’ videos. With the updated dashboard it becomes easy to get the YouTube analytics and gauge the video’s performance. Using the average view duration, you can know whether your video is being watched till the end or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-views.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="2-Playback-Location"><a href="#2-Playback-Location" class="headerlink" title="2.  Playback Location"></a>2.  Playback Location</h4><p> As ‘Playback locations’ of YouTube videos can reveal where does all the traffic come from, it would help your channel figure out for which location the video has fared well. It will guide you to reach the backlinks locations&#x2F;sites. Knowing the popular locations for your YouTube video being played, you can know whether YouTube is the search engine or they have been diverted from somewhere else. Depending on the video playing locations, the views will be segregated in to embedded video, YouTube watch page, mobile devices, and YouTube channel page. Understanding location specific views would help you decide where should you focus to enhance the performance of your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-playback-location.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="3-Demographics"><a href="#3-Demographics" class="headerlink" title="3.

Traffic sources"></a>4.  Traffic sources</h4><p> Understanding the source of your YouTube video’s traffic would help you track the prominent keywords that viewers use for landing at your YouTube video. You can figure out their choice and their search patterns this way.

Likes and dislikes"></a>7.  Likes and dislikes</h4><p> YouTube insights gauge the audience acceptance for your video by the number of likes and dislikes. Videos with a huge number of like implies that it is loved by people, though, the quality of video can’t exactly be defined by the number of likes or dislikes.

However, there are always avenues to explore that can help you increase your revenue. If you’ve never considered YouTube affiliate marketing before, or you are considering to step into it, now could be the perfect time to find out more about this valuable opportunity.</p><p>In this article, we will explain how you can make money via YouTube affiliate marketing, so read on to find out more.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What is YouTube affiliate marketing</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part2: 3 Tips before you begin</strong></a></li></ul><p>Want to join the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora affiliate program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but don’t have the media kit?

Videos are designed to show off what products can do and explain why customers should go on to make a purchase.</p><p>When you have completed your video, you can register for an affiliate marketing program and then add links to your video. The links can be placed either in the video description or as annotations in the clip itself.</p><p>Amazon affiliate marketers don’t always just produce videos – they can also promote products via articles, written reviews and more. To make your marketing program successful, you must ensure people know about your video and encourage them to click on the links and buy the products.</p><p>Though this can seem daunting at first, the more experience you gain, the more revenue you can generate.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-start-your-YouTube-affiliate-marketing-project"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-start-your-YouTube-affiliate-marketing-project" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project"></a>Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project</h2><h3 id="Step-1-build-affiliate-relationship"><a href="#Step-1-build-affiliate-relationship" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: build affiliate relationship"></a>Step 1: build affiliate relationship</h3><p>One of the first steps you should take when getting your project off the ground is to establish relationships with brands that you love. If you do have a genuine love for the product, this should be reflected in the content and encourage others to make purchases.</p><p>Viewers can often tell when your enthusiasm is not genuine, which is why it’s so important to identify products that really do appeal to you. Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.</p><p>If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it. You may find that the product, program or service that you love does not have a program. Should this be the situation, contact partners to tell them about your love for the product or service and see if they can set something up. Chances are they will be more than happy to do so, as it could be very beneficial for them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-relationship.JPG"                      alt="affiliate relationship YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Create-your-product-video"><a href="#Step-2-Create-your-product-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Create your product video"></a>Step 2: Create your product video</h3><p>The next step is to actually produce your video. Viewers love honesty, so don’t be afraid to say so if there is a way you feel the product or service could be improved.</p><p>Remember to include calls to action. Un-boxing videos are very popular and show viewers everything inside a package, whilst review videos can also provide valuable insights.</p><p>Top 10 lists also generate high views. You must also remember to include a disclosure that informs viewers that you are being paid via an affiliate marketing scheme. This is a legal obligation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/product-video.JPG"                      alt="product video YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Promote-your-content"><a href="#Step-3-Promote-your-content" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Promote your content"></a>Step 3: Promote your content</h3><p>There are many things you can do to ensure your product is seen. Share your video on all your social media channels, respond to as many questions from viewers as possible and add links to online environments where the product is already being discussed.</p><p>Set up a channel that can be found when relevant search terms are used and make sure your titles are optimized for search too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote.JPG"                      alt="promote YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Tips-before-you-begin"><a href="#Part-3-3-Tips-before-you-begin" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin"></a>Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin</h2><h3 id="1-Commission-Rate"><a href="#1-Commission-Rate" class="headerlink" title="1. Commission Rate"></a>1. Commission Rate</h3><p>All brands have different commission rates, with some offering up to 50% and others providing around 5%. Make sure you know what the rates are before you proceed and read the terms and conditions carefully. You may well wish to create a dedicated channel or channels to bring everything together. If you’re passionate about other people’s products, it makes perfect sense to get paid to talk about them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comission-rate.JPG"                      alt="comission rate YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Where-affiliate-links-appear"><a href="#2-Where-affiliate-links-appear" class="headerlink" title="2. Where affiliate links appear"></a>2. Where affiliate links appear</h3><p>Affiliate links are placed below the YouTube video in the description. One issue for YouTube affiliate marketers is that buyers tend to exit YouTube once they have clicked on your link, whether they go on to buy the product or not.</p><p>It is important to try and get as many views as possible to boost exposure for your video, whilst achieving as many sales as you can. Try to strike the ideal balance between encouraging viewers to make a purchase and to watch as much of your content as possible. The more views you receive, the more favorably your content will be treated by YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-links.JPG"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><h3 id="3-Know-your-product-well"><a href="#3-Know-your-product-well" class="headerlink" title="3. Know your product well"></a>3. Know your product well</h3><p>It is really essential to know your product inside out when you are marketing it to viewers. YouTube viewers expect you to be an expert when it comes to the products you are showcasing, so take as much time as you need to gain an in-depth understanding of how it works and what its features are.</p><p>You must also be able to explain why it makes so much sense to choose the specific product or service over its competitors. Try not to be repetitive, use HD footage and a quality mic, avoid link spamming, choose the best kind of video for the product and plan out the video before you start creating it. Again, engage with your audience as much as you can.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/know-product.JPG"                      alt="know product"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are various great reasons for getting involved in YouTube affiliate marketing. You may be amazed to see just how much cash you can generate when you follow the above steps and create inspiring videos that showcase products in the best possible light. Just remember to be honest and talk about the cons as well as the pros if they are any. Doing this will help you become a trusted, authentic YouTube affiliate marketer.

But, slow down, you have to edit all your clips together first. And then you have to export your video from the editing program, which can take a while. Then you have to wait for it to upload to YouTube, and once it’s up you have to write your description, add cards, and do a handful of other things.</p><p>The period between finishing a video and actually posting it for your subscribers to see can be long and tiresome. A lot of videos have probably died in these stages because their creators ran out of energy and patience.</p><p>Don’t let this happen to your videos! Here are 4 ways you can save time and avoid headaches during post-production:</p><p><a href="#miniproject">1. Create mini-projects</a></p><p><a href="#optimize">2. Optimize your upload speed</a></p><p><a href="#descriptiontags">3. Use default descriptions and tags</a></p><p><a href="#tubebuddy">4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</a></p><h2 id="1-Create-mini-projects"><a href="#1-Create-mini-projects" class="headerlink" title="1. Create mini-projects"></a>1. Create mini-projects</h2><p>When you have a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >large editing project <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with lots of different titles, animations, clip sequences, and PIP tracks it can get hard to keep track of everything. That’s especially true if you need to go back and make changes. A change to one part of your video could affect other parts of it.</p><p>Also, the more complex your video is the longer it will take to render&#x2F;export.</p><p>There is a way you can keep your project more organized, save time making minor adjustments, and speed up rendering: create sub-projects of different segments of your video and import them into your main project as their own clips.</p><p>This helps you in 3 ways:</p><p>1. If there are a lot of effects it’ll be faster to render a shorter video.</p><p>2. If you import your sequence as its own clip you won’t have to worry about adjusting little parts of it whenever you change earlier sections of your video.</p><p>3. If you do want to make adjustments to your sequence you can open up your mini-project and change it without affecting anything in your main project.</p><h2 id="2-Optimize-your-upload-speed"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-upload-speed" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your upload speed"></a>2. Optimize your upload speed</h2><p>At home, your videos will upload fastest if all of your internet resources are devoted to the upload. That means you should not have any other windows open on your computer while you are uploading. You should also make sure there aren’t other devices competing for wifi like smart tvs, cell phones, or really fancy coffee makers.</p><p>If you have neighbors on the same wifi signal as you and they are online at the same time, this will slow you down too.</p><p>Because there is so much that can interfere with wifi, you might want to consider a wired Ethernet cable. Ethernet connections are faster in general, and you won’t have any problems with other devices competing for resources like you get with wifi.</p><p>If you’re doing everything you can to optimize your upload speed at home and still find that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to upload videos to YouTube, go somewhere with a better connection. Save your video to a USB drive and take it to a library or college to upload. Connections in these kinds of places tend to be very strong.</p><h2 id="3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags"><a href="#3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Use default descriptions and tags"></a>3. Use default descriptions and tags</h2><p>In your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, go to <strong>Channel &gt; Upload</strong> <strong>defaults</strong>. Here you can write in titles, descriptions, and tags which will automatically be applied to every video you upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-defaults.jpg"                      alt="Creator Studio Upload Defaults"                ></p><p>Note: in the latest YouTube Studio, the upload interface is changed but the main process is similar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Upload video in YouTube Studio"                ></p><p>You probably have tags you use for almost every video you post. For example, if your channel is about vegan cooking then every one of your videos is probably tagged ‘vegan’, ‘food’, and ‘cooking’. If you type those tags in here then you don’t have to keep adding them to every new video, and you can still add or remove tags from individual uploads so you aren’t stuck using the exact same set of tags every time.</p><p>Similarly, you probably have some default text that goes in the description of every one of your videos (i.e. a link to your personal website or a brief introduction of yourself). If you type in a default description then that text will appear automatically in every new video description and you can just add to it when you need to for individual videos.</p><p>Using defaults might only save you a couple of minutes per video, but those minutes add up.</p><h2 id="4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools"><a href="#4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools" class="headerlink" title="4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools"></a>4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</h2><p>TubeBuddy is a channel management tool for YouTube. Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over.

With more than 300 hours of video uploaded onto YouTube every minute by more than ten million content creators, standing out from the competition and becoming a YouTube star can seem impossible. But, Jake Paul managed to achieve that in a short amount of time.</p><h3 id="How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul"><a href="#How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="How Old Is Jake Paul?"></a>How Old Is Jake Paul?</h3><p>Twenty-three-year-old Jake Joseph Paul was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the U.S. on January 17, 1997, to realtor father Greg Paul and nurse mother, Pam Stepnick.</p><h3 id="Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul"><a href="#Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="Logan Paul and Jake Paul"></a>Logan Paul and Jake Paul</h3><p>He and his older brother, Logan, grew up in Westlake, Ohio, and played a lot of football together growing up. Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p><p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, “Zoosh” (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.</p><p>For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school’s varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.</p><p>But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul.jpg"                      alt="jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul"                ></p><p>Image resource: <a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42548207/logan-and-jake-paul-the-brothers-dominating-social-media" >BBC NEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.</p><p>Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.</p><h3 id="Jake-Paul-and-Disney"><a href="#Jake-Paul-and-Disney" class="headerlink" title="Jake Paul and Disney"></a>Jake Paul and Disney</h3><p>Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel’s comedy series “Bizaardvark” and successfully landed the role of “Dirk.” However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake’s growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.</p><p>![Jake Paul and Disney](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Jake" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Jake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Paul disney-tubefilter.com.jpg)</p><p>Image resource:tubefilter.com</p><h3 id="Team-10"><a href="#Team-10" class="headerlink" title="Team 10"></a>Team 10</h3><p>In 2016, with all of his many exciting experiences, Jake put together a humorous and motivational memoir titled “You Gotta Want It.” As his own social media channels kept on growing rapidly, Jake launched “<strong>Team 10</strong>,” his own influencer management agency comprised of other teen social media influencers. In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.</p><p>More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-team-10.jpg.jpg"                      alt="Jake Paul and Team 10"                ></p><p>Image resource:venturebeat.com</p><p>On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled “It’s <strong>Everyday Bro</strong>.” While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p><p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p><p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.</p><h2 id="What-About-Social-Media-Success-Can-We-Learn-From-Jake-Paul"><a href="#What-About-Social-Media-Success-Can-We-Learn-From-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?"></a><strong>What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?</strong></h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Quick Follower Growth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Through First-Mover Advantage</strong></p><p>When a new social media service pops up, there’s so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform. This was the case for the Paul brothers on Vine. After the fall of Vine, the Paul brothers were able to migrate their Vine fans over to YouTube.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Know Your Audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Jake has a very good understanding of who his audience is. He knows that his audience is young. By knowing the age group that the majority of his audience falls under, Jake is then able to tailor his content in a way that captures his audience’s attention most effectively. Through high-energy prank videos and daring stunts, Jake is able to supply his audience with the content that they want. As a YouTuber, you can get an idea of who your main audience is by accessing your channel’s analytics.</p><p><strong>Commitment To Consistent Delivery of Audience-Centered Content</strong></p><p>Jake made a serious commitment to delivering audience-centered content.

The scientific explanations of ASMR and the list of its potential causes of this reaction are not as extensive as they can be.</p><p>Moreover, the visual and audio content that is designed to trigger the ASMR is perceived as unusual which further contributes to the controversy associated with this genre of videos. You are at the right place if you would like to learn more about ASMR because in this article we are going to take you through all the things you need to know about ASMR.</p><h2 id="How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work"><a href="#How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do ASMR Videos Work?"></a>How Do ASMR Videos Work?</h2><p>As strange as it may sound, millions of people around the globe are watching videos of someone whispering into a microphone, and apparently, it is helping them deal with stress, anxiety, and insomnia.</p><p>However, watching a video in any setting isn’t enough to trigger ASMR. You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing. Whether or not ASMR videos can achieve this goal is debatable.</p><h2 id="Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone"><a href="#Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone" class="headerlink" title="Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?"></a>Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?</h2><p>The short and simple answer is no. In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep. Whether or not the ASMR video will achieve the desired effect largely depends on the person watching it, because the AMSR trigger the video features may not affect the viewer who is sensitive to different types of stimuli.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers"><a href="#The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers" class="headerlink" title="The Most Common ASMR Triggers"></a>The Most Common ASMR Triggers</h2><p>It is still unclear what can trigger an ASMR since scientific research in this field has been scarce. Hence, it is difficult to know exactly what and under which circumstances can initiate such a reaction.</p><p>However, this phenomenon can be triggered by the following stimuli:</p><h3 id="1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice"><a href="#1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice"></a>1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice</h3><p>This is by far the most common ASMR trigger. Speaking in a low soft voice will likely create a tingling and pleasant sensation that will ultimately relax the listener. Consequently, the vast majority of ASMR video hosts are whispering or speaking softly into the microphone.</p><h3 id="2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks"><a href="#2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks" class="headerlink" title="2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks"></a>2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks</h3><p>The sounds created while turning the pages of a book, crumpling a piece of paper, or typing on a mechanical keyboard can all be potential ASMR triggers. It seems that the pleasant sensation is associated with the repetitiveness of these sounds, as they create a calming atmosphere.</p><h3 id="3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task"><a href="#3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task" class="headerlink" title="3. Watching someone perform an everyday task"></a>3. Watching someone perform an everyday task</h3><p>Seeing someone draw, paint, chop up food, or even write on a piece of paper can trigger the ASMR. Some people find the visual aspect of these actions relaxing, which in turn helps them get rid of the stress and sleep better.</p><h3 id="4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking"><a href="#4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking" class="headerlink" title="4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking"></a>4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking</h3><p>Chewing food loudly or slurping can generate a tingling sensation at the top of your head that later spreads through the entire body.</p><h3 id="5-Getting-attention"><a href="#5-Getting-attention" class="headerlink" title="5. Getting attention"></a>5. Getting attention</h3><p>Although almost everyone likes receiving attention, some people have a strong ASMR reaction to being the center of someone’s attention.</p><h3 id="6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors"><a href="#6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors" class="headerlink" title="6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors"></a>6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors</h3><p>Some people have the ability to trigger ASMR consciously without having to resort to audio or visual stimuli. However, this is quite rare as most members of the ASMR community rely on video and audio content to trigger the ASMR.</p><h3 id="7-Tapping-on-a-surface"><a href="#7-Tapping-on-a-surface" class="headerlink" title="7. Tapping on a surface"></a>7. Tapping on a surface</h3><p>Tapping on the surface of a microphone or the surface of plastic or metal objects is yet another common ASMR trigger. The reparative tapping sound initiates a pleasant sensation that relaxes a person.</p><h3 id="8-A-hand-touching-a-face"><a href="#8-A-hand-touching-a-face" class="headerlink" title="8. A hand touching a face"></a>8. A hand touching a face</h3><p>Tactile stimuli like a hand touching a face are known to be ASMR triggers. Besides touching a face, touching someone’s hand or hair can also trigger ASMR.</p><h3 id="9-Hearing-a-particular-genre-of-music"><a href="#9-Hearing-a-particular-genre-of-music" class="headerlink" title="9. Hearing a particular genre of music"></a>9. Hearing a particular genre of music</h3><p>People who love music often have a physical reaction to it. Hearing your favorite genre of music can produce the ASMR sensation.</p><h3 id="10-Listening-to-someone-exhale-into-a-mic"><a href="#10-Listening-to-someone-exhale-into-a-mic" class="headerlink" title="10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic"></a>10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic</h3><p>This ASMR trigger is frequently used in ASMR videos. Like all other audio ASMR triggers, blowing air into a microphone can help a person relax and fall asleep.</p><h2 id="What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular"><a href="#What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?"></a>What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?</h2><p>A little over a year ago there were more than 13 million ASMR videos on YouTube, which shows vividly how popular this genre of video has become. Moreover, the videos containing hosts and animals eating different types of food have amassed billions of views.</p><p>The stressful lives we all lead, boredom, or simply the need to experience something different are the most common reasons why people watch ASMR videos. In addition, the viewers of these videos suggest that they help them deal with depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems. Over the course of the last decade, the ASMR videos have risen from obscurity to become one of the most popular genres of YouTube videos largely due to their uniqueness and their relaxing nature.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos"><a href="#Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find ASMR videos?"></a>Where to Find ASMR videos?</h2><p>A simple google search will reveal a variety of ASMR videos, since all major video hosting platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, or Vimeo offer a broad selection of ASMR videos. Their contents vary from simple videos of hosts whispering into a microphone to carefully planned and staged role plays. Also, you try installing the app called Tingles on your Smartphone if you want to have access to a huge collection of ASMR triggers.</p><p>Moreover, ASMR videos can be found on websites that host pornographic content, which is the consequence of the sexualization of this phenomenon. Therefore where to look for ASMR videos depends on the type of ASMR content you’re looking for. One thing is certain, you won’t have much trouble finding ASMR videos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the decade, ASMR was a little known phenomenon very few people knew about. Today, ASMR videos attract huge audiences from all around the world, as they’ve become one of the most popular types of videos on YouTube and other video hosting platforms.</p><p>Despite the enormous popularity of ASMR content, we still have much to learn about the phenomenon itself and what triggers it. The little information that is available indicates that not everyone is capable of having an autonomous sensory meridian response to audio or visual stimuli. Furthermore, the potential triggers vary from whispering to watching someone prepare food, which contributes to the mystery surrounding the phenomenon.</p><p>Hopefully, this article has helped you develop a better understanding of ASMR.

Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.</p><p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Analytics"><a href="#YouTube-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Analytics:"></a><strong>YouTube Analytics:</strong></h2><ol><li><a href="#overview">Overview</a></li><li><a href="#realtime">Realtime</a></li><li><a href="#revenue">Revenue</a></li><li><a href="#adrates">Ad Rates</a></li><li><a href="#watchtime">Watch Time</a></li><li><a href="#audretention">Audience Retention</a></li><li><a href="#demographics">Demographics</a></li><li><a href="#playback">Playback Locations</a></li><li><a href="#trafficsource">Traffic Sources</a></li><li><a href="#devices">Devices</a></li><li><a href="#translations">Translations</a></li><li><a href="#subscribers">Subscribers</a></li><li><a href="#likedislike">Likes and Dislikes</a></li><li><a href="#playlists">Videos in Playlists</a></li><li><a href="#comments">Comments</a></li><li><a href="#sharing">Sharing</a></li><li><a href="#annotations">Annotations</a></li><li><a href="#cards">Cards</a></li><li><a href="#endscreens">End Screens</a></li></ol><p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu.

Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p><p>- What information it is displaying</p><p>- What issues it addresses</p><p>- What you can do to improve the results</p><p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p><h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p><p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-creator-studio-overview.jpg"                      alt="youtube-creator-studio-overview"                >  </p><h4 id="Personalize-Your-Overview"><a href="#Personalize-Your-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Personalize Your Overview"></a><strong>Personalize Your Overview</strong></h4><p>By default, the dashboard will show you the stats from the last 28 days, but you can personalize the time frame to see the data of that specific period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/data-of-specific-period.jpg"                      alt="data-of-specific-period"                ></p><p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/data-of-specific-region.jpg"                      alt="data-of-specific-region"                >  </p><p>Note: You will be able to change the time frame and region for all the data within YouTube Analytics.</p><h4 id="See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview"><a href="#See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview" class="headerlink" title="See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview"></a><strong>See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard highlights your Top 10 videos. Right away you can see the Watch Time, Views, and Estimated Revenue of those high performing videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/top-performing-videos-in-overview.jpg"                      alt="top-performing-videos-in-overview"                >  </p><h4 id="Get-Insights-On-Your-Audience-In-Overview"><a href="#Get-Insights-On-Your-Audience-In-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Get Insights On Your Audience In Overview"></a><strong>Get Insights On Your Audience In Overview</strong></h4><p>In Overview you can see where the majority of your audience is from, what gender they are, how they are discovering your videos in Traffic Source, and where they are watching your video in Playback Locations:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/your-audience-in-overview.jpg"                      alt="your-audience-in-overview"                >  </p><h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Overview Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Overview Dashboard</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard is your mission control. I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p><p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p><p><strong>2. Realtime</strong></p><h4 id="See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel"><a href="#See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="See The Performance of Your Channel"></a><strong>See The Performance of Your Channel</strong></h4><p>The Realtime report is a fantastic tool for seeing the immediate performance of your channel, which automatically updates every 10 seconds. There are two main views: The last 48 hours and the Last 60 Minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/performance-of-your-channel.jpg"                      alt="performance-of-your-channel"                >  </p><h4 id="See-Performance-of-Your-25-Most-Recently-Published-Videos"><a href="#See-Performance-of-Your-25-Most-Recently-Published-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See Performance of Your 25 Most Recently Published Videos"></a><strong>See Performance of Your 25 Most Recently Published Videos</strong></h4><p>In the Realtime dashboard, you will see the last 48 hours and last 60-minute performance of your 25 most recently published videos.</p><p>If you have recently shared a new video, you should log into the Realtime dashboard to get a quick glance at the performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/most-recently-published-videos.jpg"                      alt="most-recently-published-videos"                >  </p><h4 id="See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment"><a href="#See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment" class="headerlink" title="See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment"></a><strong>See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment</strong></h4><p>If you want to find out how many people have viewed your videos from a mobile device or how big your audience currently is, you can do that in the Realtime report.</p><p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p><p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p><p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p><p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/real-time-data.jpg"                      alt="real-time-data"                >  </p><h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Realtime Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Realtime Dashboard</strong></h4><p>If YouTube sees that your recently published video is performing well right off the bat, then it will give your video a better chance of trending, ranking higher in search, and reaching more viewers.</p><p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p><p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p><p><strong>3. Revenue</strong></p><h4 id="See-How-Much-Money-Your-Channel-Has-Made"><a href="#See-How-Much-Money-Your-Channel-Has-Made" class="headerlink" title="See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made"></a><strong>See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made</strong></h4><p>Select a specific timeline and see how much your channel has made from ads and YouTube Red viewers during that duration.</p><p>There are 3 ways to change the timeline:</p><ol><li>Dropdown menu</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/revenue-drop-down-menu.jpg"                      alt="revenue-drop-down-menu"                >  </p><ol><li>Calendar</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/revenue-calendar.jpg"                      alt="revenue-calendar"                >  </p><ol><li>Slide Bar</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/slide-bar-line-chart.jpg"                      alt="slide-bar-line-chart"                >  </p><p>You can also change how you view your data, whether Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc. This way you can see exactly how much you made each day, week, or month, and determine if you can correlate a particular dip or spike to an event that occurred.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/slide-bar-daily-view.jpg"                      alt="slide-bar-daily-view"                >  </p><h4 id="Identify-Your-Highest-Earning-Videos"><a href="#Identify-Your-Highest-Earning-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Identify Your Highest Earning Videos"></a><strong>Identify Your Highest Earning Videos</strong></h4><p>In the Revenue report, you can see which videos are earning you the most. Consider how these videos are successful:</p><p>- Was the content great?</p><p>- Was it the perfect length?</p><p>- Was it a well-structured video?</p><p>- Was the video’s pacing fast?</p><p> Once you’ve done a full evaluation, see if you can apply it to your other videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/highest-earning-videos.jpg"                      alt="highest-earning-videos"                >  </p><h4 id="Which-Country-Is-Earning-You-the-Most-Money"><a href="#Which-Country-Is-Earning-You-the-Most-Money" class="headerlink" title="Which Country Is Earning You the Most Money"></a><strong>Which Country Is Earning You the Most Money</strong></h4><p>Different countries have different rates for how much creators can make off Adsense. Click into Geography and see how much you are making in different countries and consider which audience is best to focus your attention on with the intention of increasing revenue.</p><h4 id="Compare-Estimated-Revenue-Earning-to-Other-Metrics"><a href="#Compare-Estimated-Revenue-Earning-to-Other-Metrics" class="headerlink" title="Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics"></a><strong>Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics</strong></h4><p>Know more about how your data are related by comparing to see if Revenue is affected by the performance of metrics in other categories such as Views. Does a rise in view change your revenue?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/revenue-earning-to-other-metrics.jpg"                      alt="revenue-earning-to-other-metrics"                >  </p><h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Revenue-Dashboard"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Revenue-Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Revenue Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Revenue Dashboard</strong></h4><p>Figuring <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is tricky and any insight you can get can give you an advantage, steer you in the right direction, and help you focus on what matters.</p><p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p><p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p><p><strong>4.

It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p><p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p><ol><li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li><li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li></ol><p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p><p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/average-view-duration.jpg"                      alt="average-view-duration"                >  </p><h4 id="See-Audience-Retention-of-Individual-Videos"><a href="#See-Audience-Retention-of-Individual-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See Audience Retention of Individual Videos"></a><strong>See Audience Retention of Individual Videos</strong></h4><p><strong>Absolute Audience Retention:</strong> This report shows you the number of views at every point in the video as a percentage.

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg"                      alt="how-to-use-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p><p><strong>7.
