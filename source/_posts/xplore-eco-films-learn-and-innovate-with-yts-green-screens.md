Green Screen is a widely used technology in everything from the latest Hollywood blockbusters to the weather forecast. The idea is simple: shoot a video with a single colored backdrop (blue or green is often used), and then replace the background with any other video clip, graphic or still image you want. It's highly effective and can be used for different topics and subjects. If you don't know what a green screen is and how it works, check out the video tutorial below to get an overall idea first:

In fact, nowadays, green screen is actually well within the capabilities and budget of people like you and I. Just shoot your video anywhere, and then replace the background with any stock photo, branded graphic or fantastic video clips. Want to try it out? You’d better get your own green screen ideas first. Now let’s watch some Youtube green screen videos and get inspired.
