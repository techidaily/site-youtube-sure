Objects that are closer to the lens appear much bigger while objects that are further away appear even smaller. Perspectives are also enhanced, making close objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame appear more stretched out. Out of all the other ranges in focal lengths, wide-angle lenses will appear the least zoomed in.</p><h4 id="Standard-Lens"><a href="#Standard-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Standard Lens"></a>Standard Lens</h4><p>With standard lenses or normal lenses, you won’t get the stretched out objects or enhanced perspectives that you get from wide-angle lenses. Instead, standard lenses are meant to see scenes as the natural human eye is meant to see them. If you shoot a scene with both a wide-angle lens and a standard lens from the same position, you’ll notice that less of the scene fits into your frame. Standard lenses will appear more zoomed-in than wide-angle lenses, but less zoomed-in than telephoto lenses.</p><h4 id="Telephoto-Lens"><a href="#Telephoto-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Telephoto Lens"></a>Telephoto Lens</h4><p>Out of all the other ranges in focal lengths, telephoto lenses will appear the most zoomed in. This can be beneficial for the shooter who wants to get a closer shot of a scene without having to physically be in close proximity to the scene. Objects that are further away in the background also appear larger and closer than they would appear on wide-angle or standard lenses.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006955/19272" target="_top" id="2006955">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006955" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006955/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Vlogging-With-Each-Focal-Length-Group"><a href="#Vlogging-With-Each-Focal-Length-Group" class="headerlink" title="Vlogging With Each Focal Length Group"></a>Vlogging With Each Focal Length Group</h3><p>You can get your talking head footage using lenses from any of the three focal length groups. Depending on how you plan to vlog most of the time, though, one of the three focal lengths might be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-wide-angle-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-wide-angle-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a wide-angle lens"></a>When to vlog with a wide-angle lens</h4><p>Wide-angle lenses are the most commonly used lenses for vlogging. Wide-angle lenses are great when you need to be close to your camera. This might be the case for you if your recording space is small or if you want to film yourself as you hold your camera up with your own hand.</p><p>Being close to your camera not only gives you the option to use your camera’s built-in microphone, but it also gives you the option to make use of camera-mounted shotgun microphones.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-standard-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-standard-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a standard lens"></a>When to vlog with a standard lens</h4><p>Standard lenses are great when you have more space to be further away from your camera. The perspectives in your shot will look more natural through a standard lens, making your talking head footage feel more corporate or professional. You’ll also be able to get blurrier backgrounds using a standard lens versus a wide-angle lens.</p><p>Being further away from your camera, however, means that you’ll have to use a separate microphone positioned closer to you.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-telephoto-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-telephoto-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a telephoto lens"></a>When to vlog with a telephoto lens</h4><p>As telephoto lenses are even more zoomed in, you’ll need to be even further away from your camera to fit yourself inside your camera frame. Why would any vlogger ever need to be that far away from their camera? One word… teleprompter. If you want or need to stick to a script, you’ll have to be far away enough from your camera that it doesn’t appear like your eyes are scanning left to right. You then close in the distance with a telephoto lens.</p><p>  In the above video, Marcos Rocha compares different focal lengths for talking head videos. Which focal length range do you like the look of?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137202/26400" target="_top" id="2137202">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137202" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137202/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Crop-Factor"><a href="#Crop-Factor" class="headerlink" title="Crop Factor"></a>Crop Factor</h3><p>Focal lengths in camera lenses are measured in millimeters. You can vlog yourself handheld with a 24mm lens on a camera with a full-frame sensor (the sensor is the piece of hardware inside your camera that turns the light it receives into a digital image). But if you use a 24mm lens on a camera with a smaller sensor, like an APS-C sensor or even smaller Micro 4&#x2F;3 sensor, more of you will get cropped out (see below).</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-crop-factor.jpg"                      alt="Crop Factor"                ></p><p> In order to make up for the cropping that occurs, you will need to use a wider lens on cameras with smaller sensors to get the same shot you’d get with a full-frame camera.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137206/26400" target="_top" id="2137206">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137206" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137206/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Focal-Length-Equivalency-Table"><a href="#Focal-Length-Equivalency-Table" class="headerlink" title="Focal Length Equivalency Table"></a>Focal Length Equivalency Table</h3><p>This table shows you the focal lengths needed to achieve the same shot between cameras with different sensor sizes. In order to take a shot as wide as the shot I took of myself with the 24mm lens on my full-frame camera, I would need a 15mm lens on an APS-C sensor camera or a 12mm lens on a micro 4&#x2F;3 camera.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Focal Length &#x2F; Sensor</th><th>Full Frame</th><th>APS-C</th><th>Micro 4&#x2F;3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>16mm</td><td>10mm</td><td>8mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>18mm</td><td>11mm</td><td>9mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>24mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>12mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide</td><td>35mm</td><td>22mm</td><td>18mm</td></tr><tr><td>Standard</td><td>50mm</td><td>31mm</td><td>25mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>70mm</td><td>44mm</td><td>35mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>100mm</td><td>63mm</td><td>50mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>200mm</td><td>125mm</td><td>100mm</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137974" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137974/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Aperture"><a href="#Aperture" class="headerlink" title="Aperture"></a>Aperture</h3><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture.jpg"                      alt="Camera lenses Aperture"                ></p><p> The next thing to consider when you’re looking for a lens is the aperture, the hole (often adjustable) within the lens that lets light in. Aperture for camera lenses is measured in f-stops (f&#x2F;1.4, f&#x2F;1.8, f&#x2F;2.0) - the smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture (bigger hole letting even more light in).</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture-range.png"                      alt="Camera lenses Aperture Range"                ></p><p> Because larger aperture lenses let more light in, they need a shorter time for cameras to compose an image. This is why larger aperture lenses are also called “fast” lenses.</p><p>Fast lenses are more expensive because they cost more to produce. There’s a lot more that goes into them, including larger and higher quality glass elements.</p><p>But do you even need a fast lens?</p><h3 id="Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h3><h4 id="Pros-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Pros-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h4><ul><li>Better low-light performance</li><li>Better autofocus performance</li><li>Better “bokeh” (out-of-focus areas, like your background, having that nice blurry look that you see in a lot of movies)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Cons-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h4><ul><li>More expensive</li><li>Moving subjects more likely to get out of focus when shooting with a large aperture</li><li>Better continuous autofocus performance needed when shooting moving subjects with a large aperture</li></ul><h3 id="Optical-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Optical-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Optical Image Stabilization"></a>Optical Image Stabilization</h3><p>Finally, you’ll have to decide whether or not you want your lens to have built-in optical image stabilization (OIS).</p><p>OIS is very beneficial to have on a lens if you’re a vlogger who films mostly handheld footage. Although this technology adds to the price of your lens as well, it can greatly help you to capture smoother footage that may otherwise be shaky. Nikon calls this technology “Vibration Reduction” (VR) for their lenses.</p><p>  In the above video, you can see how much OIS can help to stabilize your footage. MicBergsma simultaneously compares the footage between two GoPro Hero5 Blacks, one with OIS on and one with OIS off.</p><p>If, however, you are shooting most of your vlogs on a tripod, you won’t need a lens with OIS.</p><p> Looking for ways to set up your talking-head shot for YouTube with any of these lenses?

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram.

Check the best <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editor alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from this complete guide.</p><p>If you’ve ever been annoyed by the speed of your user-generated videos on YouTube, try out its own video editor. As YouTube has added a new “slow motion” tool to its YouTube Editor, it does pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Here is a simple guide on how to add slow motion with it.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get Access to YouTube Video Editor. You can either go directly to the URL, which is <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/editor" >https://www.youtube.com/editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or click “Upload”&gt;”Edit” to the Video Editor tab.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag your video on the timeline and double click it. In the pop up window, you will see the “Slow Motion” option. Enable it and then select how slow you want the video to be. This applies the effect to the entire video that you’ve selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/youtube-slow-motion.png"                      alt="slow motion youtube video"                ></p><p>If you just want to slow down parts of the video, go back to the main editing tab, clip it from the original video using the slicing tool and add the slow-motion effect to that clip only. You can then arrange the different clips you have in the editor to create your final video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tick the option “Preview effects side-by-side” with original video and then you can see how the original video plays compared to the one you’ve slowed down. If you’re happy with the result, hit “Done” to save the settings.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Above are the 3 ways that you can watch a YouTube video in slow motion, and slow down YouTube videos. You can directly change the playback speed of the YouTube video on Youtube, or download the YouTube video first and then slow down the speed of the YouTube video with some video editing software for YouTube like Filmora. No matter which way you prefer, we hope these information can help you slow down youtube videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img

Those who have YouTube Shorts, they can make shorts videos via the Shorts camera. Those who can’t access this camera can also upload their current vertical videos that are less than 60 seconds after adding the hashtag #Shorts in the title or description.</p><p>All in all, you must include #shorts to let the YouTube algorithm figure out the video is created for Shorts, and the issue of YouTube Shorts not showing up will also be resolved.</p><p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Sometimes, you may not find YouTube Shorts videos if they’re precisely 60 seconds in duration because YouTube sometimes adds 1-2 seconds to a Shorts video for some reason. So, be alert here and ensure your Shorts video is around 58 seconds or less.</p><p><strong>Solution 3:</strong> If your YouTube Shorts is not getting views, you need to wait more here because it takes a while for YouTube to index a Shorts video and suggest them to people. So, it’s the task of the algorithm that varies from person to person. Some Shorts videos take several days while others take weeks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111994/7443" target="_top" id="2111994">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111994" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111994/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="If-YouTube-Shorts-Videos-Are-Not-Showing-up-Correctly"><a href="#If-YouTube-Shorts-Videos-Are-Not-Showing-up-Correctly" class="headerlink" title="If YouTube Shorts Videos Are Not Showing up Correctly"></a>If YouTube Shorts Videos Are Not Showing up Correctly</h3><p>Once uploaded, the YouTube Shorts will be displayed in a vertical thumbnail on YouTube and other regular content already there in your account.

However, it doesn’t allow you to fine-edit the videos if you’ve explored the app or specifically when you want your videos to look more professional. The app doesn’t even have many filtering options, such as Effects, Elements, etc., to make your videos more interactive.</p><p>With that said, you can always use an efficient third-party program like <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a> to create professional-looking YouTube Shorts videos to engage your viewers highly. Even no famous YouTuber uploads their videos directly from the app without using any third-party tool.</p><p>We recommend Wondershare Filmora because it is a production and post-production app available for Windows and Mac computers. It gives tough competition to some globally renowned tools like Final Cut Pro X, Adobe Premiere Pro, etc., because of its simplicity. Furthermore, Filmora has its inbuilt screen, voice recording features, and webcam that can be useful to create game walkthroughs, interactive videos, and voiceovers as needed.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Moreover, a YouTube Shorts video can be made through Wondershare Filmora using the below-mentioned guide.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We are assuming that you have already recorded a vertical video using your smartphone and that it has been transferred to your PC.</p><p>So, the signature feature to create YouTube Shorts videos on Wondershare Filmora is <strong>Auto Reframe</strong>.</p><p>Powered by AI technology, Auto Reframe automatically identifies the focal point of your video and crops it while always maintaining it within the frame.

This might be needed if you have uploaded content quite some time ago and it is already outdated. Or, if you have too many videos on your channel and you need to clear up those who aren’t that interesting.</p><p> The fact of the matter is that it’s quite easy to remove YouTube videos. The first thing that you would need to do is going ahead and hop on the website and log into your account. Afterwards, you need to go to the “My Channel” option and click on the “Video Manager”.</p><p> Upon doing this, a new page is going to pop up, and you are going to see a list of all the videos that you’ve uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-video-basic-description-3.jpg"                      alt="Video list"                ></p><p> There are little tick boxes on the left side which you can click in order to mark. Mark the videos that you want to edit and click on the “Actions” button on top. There is going to be a drop-down menu, and you can click on the delete option to remove the video permanently. Furthermore, you can also hide the video if you don’t want to delete it but only to hide it away from your subscribers. In order to do so, you should simply click on the Private or Unlisted button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-remove-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="remove youtube videos"                ></p><p> That’s pretty much it – there’s nothing further to it, and the entire thing is rather comprehensive and easy to carry out, which makes it convenient to go through.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels"></a>Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels</h2><p> Now that we’ve covered how to remove videos from your own channel, it’s time to dig a little bit deeper. There are certain instances in which you might want to remove YouTube videos from other channels as well. The reasons for this are usually rather personal. For instance – someone has uploaded a video including you or something yours without your consent, and this harms your reputation. Furthermore, it may display sensitive information that you don’t want to reveal to anyone else – the reasons are rather different, but they are related to your own individual privacy which is an important legal right.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Blur Faces in YouTube Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The first thing you can do is contact the person who uploaded the video and kindly asks him to remove it using the procedure that we described above. This is going to be the best choice because it’s going to achieve the result quickly and without any hassle. However, in certain cases, the person might not be active, or he might disagree with you and keep the video posted. If that’s the case, you have one option which is likely to be the best alternative.</p><p> You need to report the video as an inappropriate and flag it with the remark that it’s invading your privacy. This is going to lead you to the page of the YouTube Safety Center. You will have to explain the issue in details in a six-step wizard which extensively asks you about how the video is invasive to your privacy rights. The process is quite comprehensive, and it’s easy to go through. However, you will have to wait for the YouTube support team to assess it and make the decision for the removal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="remove other&#39;s youtube videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997657/19272" target="_top" id="1997657">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997657" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997657/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The truth is that being able to remove YouTube videos is something important that you should be able to do.

This attention span applies to all internet platforms including YouTube. YouTube is the second largest and most visited search engine after Google. It provides users with information through engaging and eye-catchy videos. However, certain videos are longer where only a particular section of the video holds the important information. Viewers tend to skip the long videos and if you do not want this to happen to you, you can link to that specific part on your video adding value for your channel viewers with a link known as the YouTube Timestamp link.</p><p>When you have a Timestamp link on your video, you can help your viewers directly reach the specific time in the video. This helps avoid the viewers from losing interest or to search for the key part in your video themselves.</p><p>Here in this article, we will explain Timestamp links, how to add Timestamp to YouTube video links, and what are the benefits of Timestamp.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: YouTube Timestamp Links Introduction</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Adding a Timestamp to YouTube Video Link on Desktop</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Share Specific Parts of YouTube Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">part 4: Getting YouTube Timestamp Link on Mobile</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: FAQ About YouTube Timestamps</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-YouTube-Timestamp-Links"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-YouTube-Timestamp-Links" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is YouTube Timestamp Links"></a>Part 1: What is YouTube Timestamp Links</h2><p>In this fast-paced world where viewers have limited time at hand, YouTube Timestamp links are extremely helpful. These links are anchor text or video hyperlinks found either in the description beneath the video or at the video link end.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-timestamp-google-serp.jpg"                      alt=" youtube timestamps in google serp "                ></p><p>The Timestamps links allow you to put a link to a key moment in your YouTube video allowing the viewers and subscribers to view the video at the precise time specified. Your YouTube video maybe half an hour long or maybe your users do not have the time now or forget to later watch your video, but when you add Timestamp to the YouTube link, you provide them ways to get to the content quickly enhancing the user experience.</p><p>In addition to this, you can even provide a reference in minutes and hours where necessary. The YouTube Timestamp link acts as a guide that directs viewers to the part of the video, which is most relevant to them without having to watch the entire video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139115/17108" target="_top" id="2139115">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139115" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139115/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Timestamp-to-YouTube-Video-Link-on-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Timestamp-to-YouTube-Video-Link-on-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Timestamp to YouTube Video Link on Desktop?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Timestamp to YouTube Video Link on Desktop?</h2><p>In the following section, I will show you how to add timestamp to YouTube video link in several ways.</p><p><strong>Use YouTube’s Share Feature</strong></p><p>Using YouTube’s share feature is the simplest way to add Timestamp to YouTube videos. Here are easy steps to follow to do this.</p><ol><li>Open the YouTube video on your desktop that you want to share.</li><li>Play the video or navigate the timeline and stop at the key moment you wish to apply the timestamp to.</li><li>Now click on the Share button, a pop-up will appear. Under the URL, you will see a small box indicating Start at. The Timestamp is generated automatically, but you can adjust it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-timestamp-link.jpg"                      alt=" youtube timestamps link "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934142/19272" target="_top" id="1934142">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934142" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934142/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ol><li>Copy the updated URL with Timestamp to share the video or click on the social sharing icons to do so.</li><li>When your viewers click on this URL, the video will begin at the specified Timestamp.</li></ol><p><strong>Use the Browser URL to add Timestamp manually</strong></p><p>You can add Timestamp manually as well.

The A denotes the seconds at which you want the viewer to watch your video. The time can also be specified in minutes and seconds and when you want to do that just add ?t&#x3D;AmBs. For instance, ?t&#x3D;2m40s.</p><p><strong>“youtube.com&#x2F;” Format</strong></p><p>When your YouTube video link has a youtube.com format, the adjustment starts with an ampersand. &amp;t&#x3D;As or &amp;t&#x3D;AmBs is what you can use. If you are looking to add the Timestamp at 2m40s, just add “&amp;t&#x3D;2m40s at the end of the video URL.</p><p>Whenever anybody uses the URL with Timestamp, the video will start from the specified time.</p><p>However, when adding a Timestamp manually, always leave include whole numbers. For example, if the time starts at 4m, use 4 and not 04.</p><p><strong>Copy video URL at current time</strong></p><p>You can use YouTube’s built-in feature to share the key parts of your YouTube video. Follow the steps here.</p><ol><li>Visit YouTube and open the video you want to add Timestamp link to.</li><li>Play the video or navigate the timeline to reach the specific part you like to use in Timestamp.</li><li>Now either press Ctrl + click or right-click anywhere on the video.

This helps them to develop a personal brand and add context to what their audience is about to see.</p><p>- Outro - It is the customized ending of the video where most content creators choose to add a call to action (CTA) encouraging them to engage with the channel or the video in some manner.

Approval of YouTube Channel for Live"></a>2. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live</h3><p>To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel’s YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:</p><p>Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the “Profile” icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the “YouTube Studio” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the youtube studio option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144283/7443" target="_top" id="2144283">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144283" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144283/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen. From the left panel, select “Content” among other options. Under the section called “Live,” locate the “Get Started” option. Afterward, tap on the “Request” option and perform the verification steps for enabling live streaming. After 24 hours, you would get approval for live streaming on YouTube. Hence, you would be able to live stream Google Meet meetings through your YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on get ting started option"                ></p><h3 id="3-Connect-your-YouTube-Channel-to-Google-Meet"><a href="#3-Connect-your-YouTube-Channel-to-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="3.

Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet</h3><p>Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account. If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.</p><p>Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the <strong>Google Meet live stream</strong> on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube"></a>Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube</h2><p>Once you have fulfilled all the requirements, you can start a live stream from Google Meet to YouTube. Check the following steps to execute the process:</p><p>Step1 To allow Google Meet sessions to live stream on YouTube, the Google Workspace admin must adjust some settings. To begin, log in to the “Admin Console” on the Workspace administrator account. Now go to “Apps” and access the “Google Workspace” option.</p><p>Step2 Afterward, click “Google Meet” and tap on the “Stream” option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options “Let People Steam Their Meetings” and “Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings.” Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.</p><p>Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.</p><p>Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select “Live Streaming.” Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.</p><p>Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the “Start” button. You can see the red “Live” button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session. Once you have concluded the live streaming by clicking on the “Stop Streaming” button, you can check the video analytics by visiting your YouTube channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068408/7443" target="_top" id="2068408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Easily-Record-your-Google-Meet-Live-Stream"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Easily-Record-your-Google-Meet-Live-Stream" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Easily Record your Google Meet Live Stream"></a>Bonus Tip: Easily Record your Google Meet Live Stream</h2><p>Do you want to save your <strong>Google Meet live-stream session</strong>?

Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.</p><p>Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account.

Now enable the options “Let People Steam Their Meetings” and “Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings.” Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.</p><p>Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.</p><p>Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option.

Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.</p><p>Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the “Start” button. You can see the red “Live” button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session.

These vlogs are all about aesthetics, so it is important that the videos themselves are beautiful. When you are giving out tips on makeup or hair you want to use a setup that will make your results look their very best.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Beauty-Vlogger-Set-Up"><a href="#YouTube-Beauty-Vlogger-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Beauty Vlogger Set Up"></a>YouTube Beauty Vlogger Set Up</h2><p>It’s easy to put together your own Beauty Vlog setup. There are four main elements; lighting, beauty supplies, backgrounds, and audio. Here are some tips on building your beauty guru set:</p><h4 id="1-Light-It-Up"><a href="#1-Light-It-Up" class="headerlink" title="1. Light It Up"></a>1. Light It Up</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beauty-vlog01.JPG"                      alt="beauty vlog01"                ></p><p>Beauty Vlogs need to have great lighting so that everyone can clearly see what you are doing and how amazing it looks. Make sure you have even light over your whole face by ‘front lighting’ your vlog. Front lighting means having a light source right in front of you.</p><p>Depending on your budget, you can either use a window as a front light or buy a diva ring light.</p><p><strong>Using a Window:</strong>  Face the window while you vlog and be careful that the camera’s shadow is not visible in your shot. Avoid using a window the sun is shining directly into. You want softer, more diffused, light for a beauty vlog.</p><p><strong>Using a Ring Light:</strong>  Mount your camera either inside the ring or right behind it on a tripod. Ring lights are powerful options for illuminating your entire face, and they are very popular with makeup vloggers.</p><p>Front lighting can make you appear flat against your background, so it is also a good idea to set up a backlight behind you to make you pop out. Setting up lights on either side of you can also help add dimension to your shot.</p><p>Check this tutorial to know more details:</p><h4 id="2-Organize-Your-Makeup"><a href="#2-Organize-Your-Makeup" class="headerlink" title="2. Organize Your Makeup"></a>2. Organize Your Makeup</h4><p>Having to search for makeup or reach across to where you are storing your curling iron will kill your vlogging momentum. Creating a great look is the fun part of beauty vlogging, and probably the part you want to focus on. Not looking for your missing brush. The best way to set yourself up for a beauty vlog is at a desk or table where you can lay everything out neatly right in front of you.</p><h4 id="3-Alter-Your-Background"><a href="#3-Alter-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="3. Alter Your Background"></a>3. Alter Your Background</h4><p>Making your vlog look more professional can be as easy as dressing up your background. You do not want there to be a lot of clutter behind you, but you don’t want to shoot with your back to a plain beige wall either. One simple way to keep your background beautiful, but not distracting, is to use a backdrop. Just hang a sheet or other piece of fabric behind you. You can even use patterns and change your backdrop to match your makeup in different videos.</p><p>Another great way to disguise the room you are vlogging in, and make sure nothing behind you distracts your viewers, is to blur your background.

Be Audible</h4><p>You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you. Most cameras do not have great microphones, so you will need to use an external mic. To see what kinds of options you have make sure to read and watch “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Microphone for YouTube - Top 5 Mics for YouTube Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”.</p><p>If you do not have access to an external mic then you may be able to get by without one for a while using software. Make sure there is no background noise competing with your voice, and download a free audio editing program called Audacity from Audacityteam.org. Using Audacity you will be able to improve a mediocre audio recording from your camera and make it usable. This is a popular option among YouTube gamers who record both video and audio from their webcams, but there is no reason it should not be useful for beauty gurus too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-legality-check-taking-screencasts-of-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Legality Check Taking Screencasts of YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-tiktok-trends-unveiled-how-to-perfectly-reproduce-yourself-online-for-2024/"><u>[New] TikTok Trends Unveiled How to Perfectly Reproduce Yourself Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-precision-playback-aligning-video-views-in-real-time/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Precision Playback Aligning Video Views in Real-Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-streamline-your-strategy-with-aspect-ratio-mastery-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Streamline Your Strategy with Aspect Ratio Mastery on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-free-banner-templates-for-youtube-downloads-and-makers/"><u>[Updated] Free Banner Templates for YouTube Downloads & Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-quick-and-accurate-audio-to-text-conversion-on-youtube-free-methods/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Quick and Accurate Audio-to-Text Conversion on YouTube – Free Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-oppo-k11x-to-outlook-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Oppo K11x to Outlook | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-the-key-to-enhanced-viewership-designing-impactful-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>In 2024, The Key to Enhanced Viewership Designing Impactful YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-4-ways-to-trace-vivo-y36-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 4 Ways to Trace Vivo Y36 Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-unraveling-the-secrets-of-social-stardom-on-tiktok/"><u>In 2024, Unraveling the Secrets of Social Stardom on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/porating-yt-playlists-into-web-design-for-2024/"><u>Incorporating YT Playlists Into Web Design for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/trim-and-cut-mkv-videos-with-these-10-free-tools-for-2024/"><u>Trim and Cut MKV Videos with These 10 Free Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-error-connecting-to-the-apple-id-server-from-apple-iphone-6-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Troubleshooting Error Connecting to the Apple ID Server From Apple iPhone 6 Plus</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Here’s what you need to know:</p><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p><ul><li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li><li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li><li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li></ul><p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144274/7443" target="_top" id="2144274">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144274" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144274/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p><p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p><h3 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p><ol><li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li></ol><p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p><ol><li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li></ol><p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p><p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068412/7443" target="_top" id="2068412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Hook"><a href="#Hook" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p><p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p><h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be. We call this a ‘call to action’, and it could eb something as simple as subscribing through to something more involved like visiting your website.</p><p> Think about what you want from your audience; what should they do next? Remember to ask via a strong call to action, otherwise you’ve simply given them some free advice with very little in the way of a return for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Script-or-no-script"><a href="#Script-or-no-script" class="headerlink" title="Script or no script?"></a>Script or no script?</h3><p> Many YouTubers shy away from using any sort of script, feeling that this will make them less relatable and natural. Choosing whether or not to script is entirely up to you; some people feel more comfortable with a script to hand, whereas others prefer to just wing it as they go.</p><p> If you don’t feel a script would work for you, do consider having a very rough outline of your structure and the points you want to make readily available while filming. It will help you regain control if you do happen to lose your place and will ensure you get all the information across that you’d planned to.</p><p> If you do think a full script would work better for you, make sure you are able to come across as naturally as possible while reading it. Write your script the same way you speak and run through a few times so you’re not squinting at words while you’re on camera. If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Loop a YouTube Video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087485/7443" target="_top" id="2087485">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087485" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087485/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos"><a href="#Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos" class="headerlink" title="Ready to go out and make amazing videos?"></a>Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</h2><p> Having a structure to your videos might seem a little unnatural at first, but there’s plenty of evidence to show that people who take the time to plan their content get far better results than those who just improvise. If you’re unsure of the best structure for your content, watch videos made by others in your niche to see how they organize theirs.</p><p> That’s not to say you have to copy the leaders to be a success; indeed, you’ll be far more successful on YouTube if you continue to be unique. But there’s always room to learn from the best and to take inspiration from those who’ve been getting the very best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-chortle-creator-suite/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Chortle Creator Suite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-efficiently-uploading-youtube-vids-to-insta-profile/"><u>[New] In 2024, Efficiently Uploading YouTube Vids to Insta Profile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-supercharge-your-videos-with-these-proven-keyword-analyst-tools/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Supercharge Your Videos with These Proven Keyword Analyst Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-the-wanderlust-chronicles-setting-up-for-success-as-a-travel-vlogger/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Wanderlust Chronicles Setting Up for Success as a Travel Vlogger</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-top-student-vids-essential-histories-channel-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top Student Vids Essential Histories Channel List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/guard-your-gallery-with-gratis-cloud-and-paid-storage-tiers-for-2024/"><u>Guard Your Gallery with Gratis Cloud & Paid Storage Tiers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-apple-iphone-11-to-the-previous-iosipados-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Downgrade Apple iPhone 11 to the Previous iOS/iPadOS Version? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-get-the-dragon-scale-and-evolution-enabled-pokemon-on-vivo-s17-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Vivo S17 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/mp4-wav-mp3/"><u>MP4ファイルからのオーディオコンバート: WAV, MP3へと簡単ガイド</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ays-to-youtube-stardom-in-video-games/"><u>Pathways to YouTube Stardom in Video Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/transformar-videos-de-ogg-a-formato-webm-gratuito-usando-movavi-metodo-facil-y-rapido/"><u>Transformar Vídeos De OGG a Formato WebM Gratuito Usando Movavi - Método Fácil Y Rápido</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/1723004489162-unravel-the-mystery-of-mass-effects-ultimate-firepower-drops/"><u>Unravel the Mystery of Mass Effect's Ultimate Firepower Drops</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
