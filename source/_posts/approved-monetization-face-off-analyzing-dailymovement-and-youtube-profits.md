![dailymotion monetization vs youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-1.jpg)

### YouTube

A three-person team, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, founded YouTube in 2005\. Their goal is to create YouTube as a global platform for sharing videos. A huge $1.65 billion was paid by Google for buying YouTube. YouTube then became a more popular website with over two billion users every month.

Lots of creators, like makeup artists and gamers, make money on YouTube. With the platform, you can livestream, make money from your videos, and watch tons of user-made videos.

### Dailymotion

A French entrepreneur and an English entrepreneur founded Dailymotion in 2005\. Dailymotion became one of the most popular video platforms in France and then Europe in just 1 year. You can upload and share videos on Dailymotion like on YouTube. There is a slight difference in their focus. Dailymotion's content tends to be professional, while YouTube's is user-made.

Dailymotion has over 300 million users every month. It's accessible in 35 different languages. Also, for pro content, it offers features like "Motionmaker" to users and live streaming to creators.

### The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion

YouTube's user interface is very easy and simple to use. You can filter the results with date and popularity at the top bar of the website. You can watch YouTube without ads and gain access to YouTube analytics.

It's cool to create your own channel on YouTube. It allows you to upload videos, customize your banner, and create a community.

It is easy to stream videos or share them with friends by creating playlists. YouTube and Dailymotion both have easy-to-use interfaces. You can customize your own channel, and it has categories and channels. YouTube has advanced playlist features, but Dailymotion does not.

It's not all fun and games - YouTube has fewer ads than Dailymotion. A premium subscription to Dailymotion removes the ads and gives you access to other features.

### Both Platforms have Different Content and Audiences

#### YouTube Content and Audience

Video content on YouTube ranges from cooking tips to music videos. It even offers live streaming concerts and mind-blowing documentaries. Gamer, beauty, sports, and learning enthusiasts will enjoy this channel.

YouTube allows you to upload 12-hour-long videos to increase your watch time. You can also share all types of experiences in the long video. Every day, 2.51 billion active users watch over one billion hours of content. Creators can showcase their work in high definition, up to 8K, on the platform, which is a major advantage. Mobile devices and smartphones also allow offline viewing of videos.

#### Dailymotion Content and Audience

There's something special about Dailymotion. The site provides YouTube videos, animated shorts, music, documentaries, and TV shows. Although Dailymotion has upload limits, its videos are still of high quality, up to 1080p. There is a vibrant community of creators looking to connect with their audiences as well. There were 545.3 million visits to Dailymotion in April 2023, making it a strong competitor. Depending on your taste and the content you're looking for, you can choose either.

## Part 2\. YouTube vs. Dailymotion Monetization: Unraveling the Key Differences

### YouTube and Dailymotion monetization features and opportunities

It's crucial for content creators to know which monetization options each platform offers. Let's have a look at the monetization options available on YouTube and Dailymotion. It is possible to earn money from your content on both Dailymotion and YouTube. Dailymotion is easier to monetize, despite its broader and more sophisticated offering.

#### Programs and options for monetizing YouTube

There are many ways for YouTube creators to make money from their content. You can display video ads for sponsorships, AdSense payments, and merchandise sales. YouTube offers more monetization options and is more advanced than Dailymotion. The YouTube monetization rules can be tricky to meet for eligible accounts.

#### Programs and options for monetizaton Dailymotion

Creators can also monetize their content on Dailymotion. Dailymotion has fewer monetization options than YouTube. Unlike YouTube, Dailymotion allows creators to earn money through ads.

The Dailymotion Partner Program has made several French video creators extremely wealthy. The CPM is always low for video creators around the world, for whatever reason. Dailymotion Partners from France earn 3000 - 4000 euros per month. Global Partners withdraw the monthly least of $100.

![programs and options for dailymotion monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-4.jpg)

### Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential

YouTube's YPP monetizes accounts with 1,000 subscribers and earns revenue through advertising. You'll get 55% of the revenue generated by the ads shown during, before, and after your videos. It is also possible to charge channel memberships. For every 1,000 views, the average YouTuber makes about $18.

The Dailymotion Partner Program monetizes your videos. The least number of views you need to monetize your content is 1,000 (combined). One hour of watch time on the platform generates $57 in income, making it a great way to make money!

### Choosing Between YouTube and Dailymotion Channel Monetization

![choosing between dailymotion and youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-5.jpg)

Now that you've seen a YouTube vs. Dailymotion comparison, you are leaning toward one. Let's dive into some key questions if you're still not sure (you can use both platforms):

* Do you have a specific group in mind? It's important to think about who your audience is.
* Are Your Videos Targeted? Do your videos match specific search queries?
* Video Length and Size: How long and big are your videos?
* Monetization: Want to make money? Consider your subscriber count.
* Privacy Control: How much control do you need over your content's privacy?
* Analytics: Do you want detailed data on your video performance?

YouTube is your best bet if you want organic search traffic, a wide audience, and hefty videos. If you want privacy control, or if you want to monetize, Dailymotion shines.
