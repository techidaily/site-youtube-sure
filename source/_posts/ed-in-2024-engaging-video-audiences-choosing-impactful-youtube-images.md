A YouTube thumbnail must be made very engaging and attractive to tell the potential viewers what the video is about and make them watch it. Since YouTube is a visual media platform, viewers set their eyes on the thumbnails first before they read the title of the video. If you’ve made a collage of YouTube thumbnails or designed YouTube channel art containing various freeze-frame images from different YouTube videos, you are no stranger to needing a fast way to collect YouTube thumbnail images. Online, there are several tools dedicated to solving this exact problem. These are the top five YouTube Thumbnail grabbers:

These thumbnails can be then be used in videos, blogs, articles, web pages, etc. Let’s have a look at 8 best thumbnail grabbers in the market:

1. [YouTube Thumbnail Grabber](#youtubegrabber1)
2. [BoingBoing](#youtubegrabber2)
3. [Thumbnailsave.com](#youtubegrabber3)
4. [Get YouTube Thumbnail](#youtubegrabber4)
5. [Fbutube.com](#youtubegrabber5)
6. [YT Thumbnail Downloader](#youtubegrabber6)
7. [Youtubethumbnailimage.com](#youtubegrabber7)
8. [Youthumbnail.com](#youtubegrabber8)

## #1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber

![YouTube Thumbnail Grabber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-grabber.jpg)

[https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com](https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com/)

YouTube Thumbnail Grabber is at the top of our list. The website is very simple and clean with no ads. All you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click on the “Download Images” button. The site will then present you with your downloadable images in different sizes. It’s free and fast!

## #2: BoingBoing

![Boing Boing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boing-boing.jpg)

<https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html>

BoingBoing is faster than YouTube Thumbnail grabber because it skips the “Download Images” step. As soon as you enter in your YouTube video URL, BoingBoing will automatically present you with your downloadable images. Although it is one step faster than YouTube Thumbnail Grabber, you will have to deal with having to view one small ad at the bottom of the page. In case you also want to download freeze frames that occur midway through the video, BoingBoing also gives you the option to download those images as well.

## #3: Thumbnailsave.com

![Thumbnail Save](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thumbnail-save.jpg)

[http://thumbnailsave.com](http://thumbnailsave.com/)

Another free, straightforward website for grabbing your YouTube thumbnails is Thumbnailsave.com. Again, all you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click the "Submit" button. Unlike our first two options, this site has a lot more ads. You’ll see a banner ad at the top as well as an ad to the side of the page. One interesting thing about this website is that it displays a column of thumbnails recently grabbed by users all over the world (displayed on the right side of the page). You might find this entertaining. If you are captivated by one of the thumbnail images, you can download it onto your computer and then do a reverse image search on Google to find the video.

## #4: Get YouTube Thumbnail

![Get YouTube Thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-youtube-thumbnail.jpg)

[http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com](http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com/)

Get YouTube Thumbnail is another free, straightforward tool for grabbing YouTube thumbnail images. All you need to do is paste the URL of the YouTube video and click on the "Get YouTube Thumbnail" button to retrieve your thumbnail. Yes, that’s right. One thumbnail image. What’s different about this website is that it provides you with a unique image URL. This might be useful for anyone not wanting to deal with files. While this website is free to use, it does have ads.

## #5: Fbutube.com

Fbtube.com is a tool that is used to download YouTube thumbnails by bloggers, YouTubers, graphic designers, etc. This tool helps to grab all the thumbnails available for a YouTube video. All you need to do is copy and paste the link of the YouTube video you like in the search bar and tap on the Generate tab.
