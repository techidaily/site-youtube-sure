#### \- Actively Engage with Your Followers

Because YouTube's algorithm heavily bases its rankings on clicks and comments, you need to engage with your audience and open the doors for more people to watch your video. Interaction with your audience also builds a strong following. You can nurture a community by responding to comments, particularly if one of the viewers asks a direct question. Other viewers will most likely comment on your videos when they are sure you will respond.
