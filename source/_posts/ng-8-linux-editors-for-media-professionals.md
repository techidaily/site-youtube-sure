 It is true that the number of software available for Mac and Windows by far outnumber those available for Linux. Though Linux is still growing, it is always a difficult task to find specific software such as those for YouTube video editing. For Linux users, sometimes it becomes necessary to switch back to Windows whenever you need to edit your videos. Presented here are the best 8 YouTube editing software for Linux so that you avoid the back and forth movement whenever you want to work on your videos for YouTube-:
