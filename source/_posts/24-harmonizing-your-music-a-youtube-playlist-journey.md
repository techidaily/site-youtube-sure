It is closely related to the music playlists like the ones we find in Spotify and Apple music. Different playlists on YouTube are available in all genres, like entertainment, fun, relaxation, thrilling, and educational niches. Do you have a monotonous routine at the office? Let’s play something crazy and fun-filled like the comedy series or bloopers? Need some workout ideas? Check out the compilation of different custom fitness workouts as a playlist on YouTube. Whatever you want, you can find everything in YouTube playlists.

It is a fantastic app that can do wonders that one could think. Besides being used for the fun-filled purposes, they are content curation tools that can be used by marketers as a platform to attract customers and engage with them with various product videos under a single roof called playlists.

If you are a tricky person who has a changing mindset and different mood-offs, you can create your playlists that combine all your favorite videos from varied niches.

## Difference between a Channel and a Playlist on YouTube

There are times where one gets confused with the YouTube channels and playlists. While some say they are similar, the fact is both are different. A person with a specific name creates a channel, and it is the place where the person posts all the videos or uploads them for his/her subscribers to get likes and more audience.

But YouTube playlists are auto-generated contents that consist of videos from different channels but with the same content concept. For example, a PewDiePie channel will have his uploaded videos. Still, PewDiePie playlists will have all his videos and the ones similar to his stream but off the channel. Likewise, self-created playlists will have videos that you have saved to see them later or often.

## What are the benefits of a playlist on YouTube?

There are various YouTube and video creators who have undervalued playlists' importance, and hence the hidden benefits are often off-screen. So, we have listed the top 5 reasons why YouTube playlists are essential and how a YouTuber can benefit from playlists.

#### 1\.  YouTube playlists help you organize videos in order

YouTube these days appears scattered with numerous information where some are important at the critical instances of time. You also have some playlists that are the effective ones grouped based on a common theme. Suppose your company focuses on selling musical equipment. In that case, you can make separate playlists for a guitar or pianos so that viewers can come across different equipment styles, available variants allowing them to navigate through various parts in your channel. Alongside this, you can tell your viewers what the YouTube channel or the organization is all about at first glance as the first impression is the best expression!

#### 2\.  Increase the rank of your video

If your video gets added to a playlist, there are high chances for it to be in the YouTube watchlist even it is less popular but related to the ones that the audience prefers. In turn, this act raises your video's rank as the "total watch time" is a vital factor that drives your video to the highly ranked video list.

#### 3\.  Playlists account to discoverability and improve visibility on search engines

Apart from being enlisted as single videos, individual videos indexed in playlists get opportunities to appear on the search engines based on the keywords. Playlists are bread slices packed with jam as keywords providing likelihood to emerge on multiple times. But to catch the gain of this method, one has to enrich the video with an outstanding keyword, titles, or description and optimize the video with remarkable SEO techniques.

#### 4\.  Get more views

When your video comes under a theme and is categorized, the YouTube algorithm places it over with the other related to each other. The next time, your video will appear on the right sidebar below the "related videos." As the video plays automatically, one after the other, the number of views increases. "Amazing playlists can make viewers watch it longer!"

#### 5\.  Playlists are best for video SEO

Such playlists can boost and help one to reach your YouTube channel. Especially when it comes to educators or artists, they provide value and save time. Playlists get ranked for keywords that help your audience in reaching you on YouTube.
