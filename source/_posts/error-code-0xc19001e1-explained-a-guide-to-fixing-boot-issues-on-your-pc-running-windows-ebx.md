## Try these fixes

1. [Remove periphery devices](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update your drivers (100% working for HP users)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-error-0xc19001e1-in-windows-10/#f2)
3. [Disable antivirus](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Use Windows troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

6. [Free up disk space](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. [Reset or reinstall Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Remove periphery devices

 This should be the first thing to do when problems occur. This is the easiest way to check whether external devices conflict with Windows Updating Process. By removing all periphery hardware components except for the mouse and keyboard, we’ll know whether it’s a hardware issue.

 If this does sort out the issue, try plugging back each device one by one. In this way, you can recognize which device causes the problem.

 If it’s not sorting out the issue, let’s head to the next fix.

 Therefore, disable the antivirus software then restart your PC to apply the change. Update your Windows system and see if it fixes the issue.

Don’t forget to enable the software afterward.

If the error persists, move to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Use Windows troubleshooter
