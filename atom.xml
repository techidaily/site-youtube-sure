It’s also a great way to keep your visitors engaged on your site for more extended periods.</p><p>To help you with the process, we’ll explore different step-by-step methods to embed a YouTube playlist on a website to add interactivity to your site.</p><p>So, if you’re ready to get started, read on!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-To-Embed-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-a-Website"><a href="#How-To-Embed-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-a-Website" class="headerlink" title="How To Embed a YouTube Playlist on a Website"></a>How To Embed a YouTube Playlist on a Website</h2><p>If you want to embed and display a YouTube playlist on your website, we’ll give you a complete rundown of the three methods you can try to get this done. But, of course, each method has its pros and cons, so you’ll need to decide which is right for you.</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to embed a YouTube playlist on a Website:</strong></p><h3 id="Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-Website-Using-WordPress-Plugin"><a href="#Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-Website-Using-WordPress-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="Embedding a YouTube Playlist on Website Using WordPress Plugin"></a>Embedding a YouTube Playlist on Website Using WordPress Plugin</h3><p>The plugin is the simplest way to add a YouTube Playlist to your WordPress website. This will help you get this done in no time without having to write any code for the process.</p><p>With plugins like <a class="link"   href="https://smashballoon.com/youtube-feed/" >YouTube Feed Pro by Smash Balloon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can extend your website’s functionality and create, customize, or embed a YouTube playlist with just a few clicks of a mouse.</p><p>To embed and add a YouTube playlist on your website page&#x2F;post, do the following steps in sequence:</p><p>Step1 Launch a browser on your PC and head to your <strong>WordPress website’s login page</strong>. Sign in to your dashboard using your username and password.</p><p>Step2 Click the <strong>“Plugins”</strong> option from the left-hand side menu on the WordPress dashboard. Now, click <strong>“Add New”</strong> and use the search option to find and install the <strong>YouTube Feed Pro</strong> plugin. Afterward, click the <strong>“Activate”</strong> option to enable the plugin.</p><p>Step3 Click the <strong>“YouTube Feed”</strong> option from the left menu and open <strong>“All Feeds.”</strong> On the next page, click <strong>“Add New”</strong> at the top left of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/creating-new-feed-in-the-youtube-feed-plugin.png"                      alt="creating new feed in the youtube feed plugin"                ></p><p>You will now be asked what type of feed you want to create.

Click <strong>“Add”</strong> to connect your YouTube account to the plugin.</p><p>Step5 Select the Playlist you want to display on your WordPress website and take its <strong>ID</strong>. Paste that in the next pop-up window and click <strong>“Next”</strong> to continue the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/adding-playlist-id-to-embed-in-website.png"                      alt="adding playlist id to embed in website"                ></p><p>Your YouTube playlist will be connected to your WordPress website. To further customize it, select the template you want and click <strong>“Next.”</strong> You can also configure the <strong>Feed Layout</strong> and <strong>Color Scheme.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/customizing-youtube-playlist-embedded-in-website.png"                      alt="customizing youtube playlist embedded in website"                ></p><p>Step6 Once you are done with customization, click the <strong>“Embed”</strong> option on the top-right side of the screen, and a pop-up window will appear. Next, click <strong>“Add to a Page,”</strong> and a list of pages on your website will be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/adding-playlist-to-website-page.png"                      alt="adding playlist to website page"                ></p><p>Choose your page and click <strong>“Add”</strong> at the bottom of the pop-up window. You’ll be directed to a new page where you can embed the feed. Click the <strong>“Plus”</strong> icon at the top-left of the screen, search for <strong>YouTube Feed</strong> and choose the <strong>Feeds for YouTube</strong> block to embed and add your playlist.</p><p>That’s about it! You’ve successfully embedded a YouTube playlist on your WordPress website.</p><h3 id="Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-a-Website-Using-oEmbed-Code"><a href="#Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-a-Website-Using-oEmbed-Code" class="headerlink" title="Embedding a YouTube Playlist on a Website Using oEmbed Code"></a>Embedding a YouTube Playlist on a Website Using oEmbed Code</h3><p>Another method to embed a YouTube playlist on your WordPress website is to use oEmbed Code. This method requires basic CSS, HTML, or Java knowledge; otherwise, you won’t be able to customize your playlist.</p><p>Moreover, this method is too complicated for beginners, and you will miss the customer support provided by WordPress plugin developers in case of any mishaps.</p><p>To use the oEmbed Code method, do the following steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, head to your YouTube account and access the Playlist you want to embed. Next, click the three dots below it and copy its URL.</p><p>Step2 Now, login to your WordPress dashboard and open the post or page editor where you want to add the playlist.</p><p>Step3 Paste the URL directly in the editor and click <strong>“Update”</strong> to save the changes.</p><p>WordPress will grab your playlist from YouTube and automatically show it in your post using oEmbed. The outcome is a single video with a menu that your viewers can click to see other videos in the playlist.</p><h3 id="Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-WebsiteUsing"><a href="#Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-WebsiteUsing" class="headerlink" title="Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing "></a>Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing <iframe ></h3><p>Another way to embed a playlist of your YouTube channel on your WordPress site is by using the iFrame code with the following step-by-step instructions:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch a browser on your desktop or laptop and go to your <strong>YouTube channel.</strong></p><p>Step2 Now, head to the YouTube playlist you want to embed, click the <strong>“Share”</strong> icon, and a pop-up window will appear.</p><p>Step3 Choose the <strong>“Embed”</strong> option, and a new lightbox pop-up will appear, having your playlist’s embed code.

Click the <strong>“Plus”</strong> icon, search for <strong>“custom HTML,”</strong> and select <strong>“Custom HTML block”</strong> to add to the page&#x2F;post.</p><p>Now, paste the iFrame embed code you’ve copied from YouTube and click “Update” at the top-right of the screen to save the changes and embed your playlist.</p><p>This method will also display one video with a menu from where you and your website viewers can access the playlist.

Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p><p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p><h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p><p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p><h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p><p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p><h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p><h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p><h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg"                      alt="collab pitch examples"                ></p><p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! It’s from filmora.io’s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers" >download with the Get Subs Guide here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Here are some more tips:</p><h4 id="1-Use-Their-Name"><a href="#1-Use-Their-Name" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p><h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p><h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Pitch Video Ideas"></a><strong>3. Pitch Video Ideas</strong></h4><p>You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep Your Message Simple"></a><strong>4. Keep Your Message Simple</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.</p><h4 id="5-Be-an-Equal"><a href="#5-Be-an-Equal" class="headerlink" title="5. Be an Equal"></a><strong>5. Be an Equal</strong></h4><p>Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You don’t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you can’t be both).</p><h4 id="6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page"><a href="#6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page" class="headerlink" title="6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page"></a><strong>6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p><p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1374819">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374819.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1374819">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374819.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1374819%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1374819/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Collab Video"></a><strong>How to Make a Collab Video</strong></h2><p>Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.</p><h4 id="Shout-Each-Other-Out"><a href="#Shout-Each-Other-Out" class="headerlink" title="Shout Each Other Out"></a><strong>Shout Each Other Out</strong></h4><p>This is the easiest way to collab because you don’t have to meet up or do much planning together. Essentially, you just make your own video and let everyone know how much you like your partner’s channel (combined with linking your viewers to them), and they do the same.</p><p>Make sure to agree beforehand on how long you’ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesn’t go on way longer than the other.</p><p>This probably isn’t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldn’t check out someone’s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.</p><h4 id="Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>This might be the most fun type of collab to watch. The person whose channel the video appears on is the ‘host’ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.</p><p> Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.</p><p>In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.</p><h4 id="Long-Distance-Collaborations"><a href="#Long-Distance-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="Long Distance Collaborations"></a><strong>Long Distance Collaborations</strong></h4><p> It’s harder to collab if you can’t meet up, but it isn’t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each other’s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.</p><h2 id="Launching-Your-Collab"><a href="#Launching-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Launching Your Collab"></a><strong>Launching Your Collab</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you’ve made.</p><h4 id="Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time"><a href="#Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time" class="headerlink" title="Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time"></a><strong>Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time</strong></h4><p>If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. It’ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner&#x2F;their collab video and when people go to check that out it isn’t up.</p><p>You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if you’re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to ‘public’ at the exact same time.</p><h4 id="Promote-Your-Collab"><a href="#Promote-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Promote Your Collab"></a><strong>Promote Your Collab</strong></h4><p>Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.</p><h4 id="Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Comment on Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Comment on Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>After you’ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner’s subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you’re buddies with one of their favorite creators.</p><p> Make sure to discuss how much promotion you’ll each do for the collab before and after it launches. If one of you does a ton of promotion and the other just does one tweet, it won’t make the person who’s done way more promotion feel great.</p><p> Have you ever collaborated on YouTube?

It is understandable that there will be a learning curve if you just want to get tons of subscribers on your channel – who doesn’t? Ultimately, in getting a standard video that will attract and sustain the interest of the viewers, you will need to employ certain strategies that will enhance your credibility.</p><p>Let’s tell each other the truth, no one wants to watch a video that is not aesthetically appealing even if it is a close friend. So, if you have got the relevant content and the video to pull traffic to your channel, what you will need is editing software that will help you make the correct adjustments to your video</p><p>Nobody wants a random viewer to comment “This video is a little bit tacky, touch-up properly”, that will definitely leave a sting. As such, understand the best technique that works for you as well as the software that meets your needs based on the current level of expertise. It is okay for you to grow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/advanced%20video%20cutter.png"                      alt="advanced%20video%20cutter"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have"><a href="#Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have" class="headerlink" title="Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have"></a>Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have</h2><p>As much as the enthusiasm is brewing to get on your mac and upload the video you just shot, there are certain elements you need to implement to make a cool video for YouTube. Beginners sometimes feel their content is the best, the excitement of posting their very first series can be overwhelming. Sometimes, it blocks off other ideas for making the video better.</p><p>However, having amazing content dies not to exclude the need for the right editing technique. Here are five methods for editing your YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="1-Control-the-video-duration"><a href="#1-Control-the-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="1.Control the video duration"></a>1.Control the video duration</h3><p>The length of a particular scene can have different meanings depending on how long or short it is in a video. This means the duration can impact the message you are trying to pass across to your viewers, hence it is important to know what places to accelerate and cut in the video.</p><p>You can have a system where each part of the content is labeled in their order of importance such as A, B, C. This means from the most important to the least important. Consequently, you will be able to sieve through the content and make the appropriate changes while editing the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-mac-change-default-transition-duration.jpg"                                     ></p><h3 id="2-Customize-the-intro-and-end-of-the-video"><a href="#2-Customize-the-intro-and-end-of-the-video" class="headerlink" title="2.Customize the intro and end of the video"></a>2.Customize the intro and end of the video</h3><p>It is possible to grab the attention of the viewer in the intro and even more likely to lose someone once the opening montage comes in. Creating an intro that is captivating and appealing to drag the audience to your video is an important technique for editing your videos. Also, the end of the video, from the signing out to the closing montage has to appeal to the audience. You will be surprised by the number of people that love seeing end credits if the closing montage is good. Customize the intro and the end of the video so the audience is tuned all through.</p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best YouTube Banner Size and Channel Art Dimension (The Ultimate Guide) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Add Logo or Watermark to YouTube Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters"><a href="#3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters" class="headerlink" title="3.Use Cool transitions or filters"></a>3.Use Cool transitions or filters</h3><p>If there is anything the audience love to see, it is the way you move from different points in the vudeo.

Here are some of the features you can use:</p><ul><li><strong>Crop:</strong> The crop tool allows you to resize and reposition your thumbnail image by trimming away any unnecessary parts of the image.</li><li><strong>Rotate:</strong> The rotate tool lets you adjust the orientation of your thumbnail image. You can rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise to achieve the desired angle.</li><li><strong>Adjust lighting and color:</strong> The lighting and color tools allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and other aspects of the thumbnail image to enhance its overall appearance.</li><li><strong>Add text:</strong> You can use the text tool to add words or phrases to your thumbnail image. This can be a great way to include a call-to-action or to highlight a key feature of your video.</li><li><strong>Add filters and stickers:</strong> The Photos app includes a range of filters and stickers that you can use to give your thumbnail image a unique look. You can experiment with filters and stickers to find the perfect one for your thumbnail.</li></ul><p>To create a thumbnail using the Photos app on your iPhone, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Open the Photos app and find the image you want to use as your thumbnail. <strong>Tap</strong> on the image to open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-photo-app.jpg"                      alt="ios photo app"                ></p><p>Step2 Tap the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the top right corner of the screen.

What App Do Youtubers Use To Make Thumbnails?</h3><p>There are many different apps and tools that YouTubers use to create thumbnails for their videos. The best app for creating YouTube thumbnails will depend on your needs and skill level.</p><p>If you’re looking for a quick and easy way to create a thumbnail on your mobile device, start with the built-in Photos app or a third-party app like Canva. If you need more advanced customization options or are comfortable with graphic design software, consider using Adobe Photoshop or another tool.</p><h3 id="Q2-What-Is-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size-1"><a href="#Q2-What-Is-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size-1" class="headerlink" title="Q2. What Is YouTube Thumbnail Size?"></a>Q2. What Is YouTube Thumbnail Size?</h3><p>The recommended size for YouTube thumbnails is 1280 x 720 pixels. This size balances quality and file size, ensuring that your thumbnail looks sharp and loads quickly. It’s also important to note that YouTube thumbnails are displayed at different sizes depending on the device and context in which they are viewed.</p><p>For example, a thumbnail may be displayed at a larger size when it’s shown as the main thumbnail for a video but smaller when it’s shown in a list of related videos.</p><h3 id="Q3-What-Thumbnail-Gets-the-Most-Clicks-1"><a href="#Q3-What-Thumbnail-Gets-the-Most-Clicks-1" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What Thumbnail Gets the Most Clicks?"></a>Q3. What Thumbnail Gets the Most Clicks?</h3><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the thumbnail that gets the most clicks can vary depending on the topic of your video, your target audience, and other factors.</p><p>However, the key to getting clicks on your thumbnail is to make it visually appealing and relevant to your video. Experiment with different thumbnail designs and track which ones get the most clicks to help you identify what works best for your channel.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Many tools are available for creating YouTube thumbnails, including the built-in Photos app on mobile devices and third-party apps like Pixelab. One particularly powerful option is Filmora, a video editing software with features for creating custom thumbnails, such as adding text, graphics, and special effects.</p><p>Whether you create your thumbnails on your mobile device or your computer, use a high-quality image and make the thumbnail relevant to your video to increase the chances of it getting clicked.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-complete-guide-to-twitters-paid-reach-and-impressions/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Complete Guide to Twitter's Paid Reach and Impressions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-playlist-of-timeless-anime-themes/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Playlist of Timeless Anime Themes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-banner-brilliance-elevating-your-game-channel-image/"><u>[Updated] Banner Brilliance Elevating Your Game Channel Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-ideal-mp4-slicer-for-mac-boost-your-vlog-game/"><u>[Updated] Ideal MP4 Slicer for Mac Boost Your Vlog Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-no-money-no-problem-your-guide-to-free-youtube-ads/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, No Money, No Problem!

Making video viewers enjoy enough that they click on your channel page - that’s hard. Channel art is just about reinforcing the positive feelings viewers have come away from your videos. Anyone who’s looking at your channel art is already thinking about subscribing to you. Your banner should make viewers feel happy with the choice they’ve already half-made.</p><ol><li><a href="#basics">YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</a></li><li><a href="#resources">Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</a></li><li><a href="#makers">Free Channel Art Makers</a></li><li><a href="#tips">How to Make Good Channel Art</a></li><li><a href="#inspiration">Channel Art Inspiration</a></li></ol><h2 id="YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics"><a href="#YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics"></a><strong>YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</strong></h2><p>YouTube channel art should be 2560 x 1440px.</p><p>As long as you upload an image or background that is that size, viewers looking at your channel on any device will be able to see that you’ve taken the time to personalize your channel page.</p><p>If you want to make a bit more of an impression, you can start thinking about banner dimensions. Depending on what type of screen (laptop, mobile, television) a viewer is visiting your channel on, they will see a different crop of that 2560 x 1440px channel art. That cropped image is your banner.</p><p>Television will display the entire image, but it is significantly smaller on other devices.</p><p>Desktop or laptop computers can show a view as large as 2560 x 423px, or as small as 1546 x 423px.</p><p>Tablets show an area that’s 1855 x 423px.</p><p>Mobile phones show an area that’s 1546 x 423px. This size is also the smallest possible desktop&#x2F;laptop view, and it is considered the ‘safe area.’ Any important text or graphics in your banner should fit within this section, or they could be awkwardly cut off in some views.</p><p>Here’s a visual guide to channel art dimensions:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/channel-art-cheat-sheet.jpg"                      alt="channel-art-cheat-sheet"                ></p><p>Another important detail to consider is the size of your file. YouTube will allow your channel art to have a file size of up to 6MB, but no larger.</p><h2 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of free resources online, which can make the process of designing your channel art simple, including <a href="#templates">templates</a>, <a href="#photos">stock images</a>, <a href="#patterns">backgrounds</a>, and <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p><h4 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to get great channel art might be to find something pre-built you can personalize. There are a few places online you can find something free that will suit both your style and the types of videos you make:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>filmora.wondershare.com</strong></a></p><p>Here on filmora.io, we have a selection of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >50 free channel art templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download. The banners are divided into 10 categories representing both different types of YouTube channels (i.e., gaming and beauty) and different popular styles (i.e., minimalist and galaxy), so there’s something for everybody. When you download the free templates, you can choose between PSD files, so you can customize your banner in Photoshop and PNG files you can use with a free online program like Canva (or even Paint on your computer).</p><p><a href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/"><strong>Visme</strong></a></p><p>On Visme, you’ll find another 50 free YouTube banners with themes like ‘Rock Star,’ ‘Makeup Tutorial,’ and ‘Cooking Lessons.’ The banners all make use of beautiful high-quality photographs (no patterned backgrounds). You can add your own channel name right on Visme and customize your font&#x2F;color.</p><p><a href="http://yourtubetheme.com/channel-art/"><strong>YourTube</strong></a></p><p>There is a massive amount of resources available on YourTube, which you can download for free. The category labeled templates only has 14 options, but there are really hundreds of options for YouTube channel art. ‘Templates’ just means downloads, which include PSD files where you can edit text. Under ‘All YouTube Channel Art,’ there are over 500 options. Some are patterned backgrounds, some are pictures, but all of them were designed to be channel art. It’s easy to look and imagine where your channel’s name will go.</p><p>There are also a lot of <a href="#makers">Channel Art Makers</a>, which include templates!</p><h4 id="Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts"><a href="#Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts"></a><strong>Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts</strong></h4><p>Sometimes all you need to do is add some text to a really great photo or background pattern. You can find awesome-looking and free options for all three of these things and piece together your own unique channel art.</p><p><strong>Free Stock Photos for YouTube Channel Art</strong></p><p>Unlike templates, stock photos will not already be the exact right size for uploading to YouTube. You’ll have to adjust them, but you don’t need expensive software to do this. You can use a banner maker, or just do some trimming in Paint. While you are making adjustments, <a href="#basics">keep the dimensions</a> from the first part of this article in mind, so important details aren’t partially cut off on some devices.</p><p>There are a lot of beautiful photographs available online, and sites like Stocksy are great if you have the budget available to purchase images. If you need free options, then there are lots of those too, but you do sometimes need to be careful that the way you want to use an image is allowed within the license provided by the site or photographer.</p><p>We recommend these two sites for anybody who finds copyright rules confusing because both of these sites allow you to use their photos for free, for any purpose (commercial or personal), without attribution (although they do appreciate attribution).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-unsplash"                ></p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/"><strong>Unsplash:</strong></a> This site has a huge selection, and more photos are being added all the time. Finding what you want is as easy as typing a keyword (i.e., ‘sunset’) into the search bar on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-pexels.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-pexels"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/"><strong>Pexels:</strong></a> you can find a wide variety of images on Pexels just by using the search bar on the main page, much like Unsplash. There is actually some overlap in the images available on the two sites, but they also each have photos the other doesn’t, so it’s worth looking at both.</p><h4 id="Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Photographs just don’t suit every type of channel. If you don’t think photos of scenery match the style of your channel, you might want to consider a background pattern. Because patterns repeat, you don’t need to worry much about things being cut off when you upload a pattern as channel art (although you’ll still need to make sure any text you add is in the <a href="#basics">safe area</a>).</p><p>One thing you should watch for when using a background pattern is that text can sometimes be hard to read if it’s sitting on top of a busy pattern. You might want to put a box of solid color between your channel name and the pattern.</p><p>The patterns on the following two sites are free to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library.png"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library"                ></p><p><a href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/"><strong>The Pattern Library:</strong></a> this truly is a library, and all the patterns were submitted by real graphic designers. When you first arrive on the site, all you’ll see is a randomly selected pattern filling your entire screen. Hovering over the designer’s name in the top left will allow you to download it for free.</p><p>Often, the download will not be as large as the image you see on the site. It will only be a few tiles (or just one tile), and you will need to copy&#x2F;paste it a few times to create a background large enough to use as channel art.</p><p>You can use the navigation tools in the top right of the screen to see more patterns. Clicking the icon that looks like a bunch of squares will allow you to see multiple patterns at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.heropatterns.com/"><strong>Hero Patterns:</strong></a> the patterns on this site are editable before you download. You choose a foreground color, a background color, and the opacity of the design in the foreground. This means that you can make the pattern as subtle or vibrant as you want, which is a great thing to have control over when you’re creating channel art.</p><p>When you choose your custom colors and opacity, every pattern preview on the page will update. You can put in the colors you like for your channel first, and then find a pattern that looks good with them.</p><p>The only downside to Hero Patterns is that downloading your pattern is hard. You actually can’t just download it. Instead, the site generates a code you can embed on a website.</p><p>If you don’t have a website, the easiest thing is probably to use the Snipping Tool (included on all PCs since Vista) to save the preview and then just copy&#x2F;paste it as a tile in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p><h4 id="Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art"><a href="#Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>Whatever program you use to build your channel art will already have a selection of fonts. Finding the perfect font to use across your channel art, thumbnails, and for any text, you include in your videos isn’t something you need to think about until your channel is large enough that you’re thinking about your ‘brand’. If you feel like you’re at that stage, or want to get a jump start on it, here are a couple of sites where you can find free fonts and install them on your computer.</p><p><a href="https://www.dafont.com/"><strong>DaFont:</strong></a> there are categories on this site like fancy, gothic, and script, and there are even sub-categories like sci-fi and calligraphy. Licensing limits (whether the font is free and whether it is available for commercial use) will be clearly displayed next to every font. When browsing, you can even type your channel name in where it says ‘Preview’ and see what it will look like in all the different fonts.</p><p><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/"><strong>Font Squirrel:</strong></a> the nice thing about this site is that everything is guaranteed to be free and available for commercial use. If you scroll down a bit on the main page, you’ll see a toolbar to the right of the screen, which will allow you to narrow down the fonts being displayed by selecting tags like grunge, headings, and casual.</p><p>Once you’ve got an image or images, and maybe even a font you want to use in your banner, you can create your channel art in either a software like Photoshop or a free banner maker (anchor) like the ones below.</p><h2 id="Free-Channel-Art-Makers"><a href="#Free-Channel-Art-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Free Channel Art Makers"></a><strong>Free Channel Art Makers</strong></h2><p>You don’t need an expensive program like Adobe Photoshop to make great channel art. There is a lot of photo editing and graphic design programs available for free online, and most of them are a lot easier to use.</p><p>All three of these sites will allow you to build your banner just by dragging images and text to where you want them, and they even provide premade templates (although those might not be free in some cases).</p><p><a href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></p><p>Canva is probably the most popular site for creating YouTube banners for free, for a good reason. It’s extremely intuitive for beginners who are making their first graphics, and it’s also a capable enough program to satisfy more intermediate-level users. Canva has stock images, banner templates, and other graphics available, but some of them cost $1 to use. You can also upload your own media instead of relying on Canva’s resources.</p><p>To build channel art in Canva, find ‘YouTube Channel Art’ as one of the options, and you’ll be working with a canvas that’s already the right size. You can also choose from a lot of different layout options, which will divide your canvas into different drop zones for images (pictures will be auto-sized to fit the zone).</p><p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Canva is the huge library of stock images, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that you can’t have multiple images stretched to the end of your canvas.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/"><strong>Wondershare PixStudio:</strong></a></p><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p><p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of PixStudio is that it provides a feature to remove the image background, you can use the image more flexibility. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the features will be used after payment of $7.99 per month.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ultimate-guide-to-effective-youtube-banners.jpg"                      alt="Wondershare PixStudio Banner Maker"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.designwizard.com/"><strong>Design Wizard</strong></a></p><p>This is another easy to use image editor with templates and stock images, like Canva. You just select YouTube Cover from the options in the Social Media menu (there are also options for YouTube Thumbnails and Profile Pics).</p><p>In Canva, images you drag into your layout will automatically shift to fit the area you put them into. This doesn’t happen in Design Wizard, which can either slow down or speed up your process, depending on which you prefer.</p><p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Design Wizard is that it provides you with a ‘safe zone box’ so you can see the smallest view of your channel art while you work. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the photos in Design Wizard aren’t free, so you’ll either have to buy them or use your own.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> the safe zone box costs $1, so the price of your download will always look like $1 until you delete it when you’re finished designing. Then your price will drop to $0 if you haven’t used any other paid elements.</p><p><a href="https://www.fotor.com/"><strong>Fotor</strong></a></p><p>Fotor works similarly to the other two programs on this list. Just look for ‘YouTube Channel Art’ in the Header &amp; Cover section and click on it to start designing. It does not have layouts like Canva, but it is also a drag-and-drop program, and it is better than Canva if you like to edit with layers.</p><p>Fotor has more free templates than Canva or Design Wizard, although it does also have some premium options. Creating a paid account will allow you to access premium resources and get rid of ads (costs $39.99 for the year), but if all you want it for is to create channel art, a paid account probably isn’t worth it.</p><p>You can upload your own images to use in Fotor as well.</p><p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of Fotor is that it has a lot of genuinely free channel art templates you can customize, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that it doesn’t have as many stock photos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art"><a href="#How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Good Channel Art"></a><strong>How to Make Good Channel Art</strong></h2><p>Finding an image, cutting it to the right size, and uploading it to YouTube is easy, but how many of your favorite YouTubers use just an image for their channel art? Usually, there’s at least a little text stating the name of the channel.</p><p>In this section, we’ll give you a quick checklist of things to include in your banner (anchor), and some tips on making excellent channel art.</p><h4 id="Channel-Art-Checklist"><a href="#Channel-Art-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Checklist"></a><strong>Channel Art Checklist</strong></h4><p>Here are some things you might want to include in your YouTube banner. Not all of these are right for every type of channel.</p><ol><li>Channel name</li><li>What kinds of videos you make</li><li>Your posting schedule</li><li>Social media handles</li><li>Your face</li><li>A tagline</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-layout.jpg"                      alt="YouTube channel art layout"                ></p><h4 id="Top-5-Tips-for-Making-Great-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Top-5-Tips-for-Making-Great-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Tips for Making Great YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Top 5 Tips for Making Great YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Besides looking good, your channel art can help convince more of your viewers to become subscribers. Here are our top 5 tips for making channel art that looks impressive and supports the growth of your channel.</p><ol><li><a href="#solidbackground">Solid Background Behind Text</a></li><li><a href="#minimaltext">Keep Text to a Minimum</a></li><li><a href="#imagesandcolors">Use Images and Colors That Suit Your Channel</a></li><li><a href="#face">Include Your Face</a></li><li><a href="#reason">Give Viewers a Reason To Subscribe</a></li></ol><p><strong>Solid Background Behind Text</strong></p><p>When viewers look at your channel page, you want your name and any other information your banner conveys to jump out at them. It is hard for text to jump out at anybody when it’s competing with a busy background, especially if some of the colors in the background are similar to the color of the text.</p><p>If possible, you can place your text on the part of your background pattern or image where there isn’t much happening behind it. When that isn’t possible, it doesn’t mean you need to find a new background. Instead, insert a solid-colored shape between the text and your background image. Your text will look great, and you won’t have to compromise on a background you like.</p><p><strong>Keep Text to a Minimum</strong></p><p>There is a lot you might want to say in your banner. You’ll want to tell viewers the name of the channel, what kinds of videos you make, when you upload those different kinds of videos, and maybe even the general philosophy driving your channel (i.e., ‘to spread positivity’). That’s all great, but try to say it fast.</p><p>Realistically, viewers probably won’t read more than one line of text. Writing more than that could also force you to use smaller text that viewers will have trouble reading. Ideally, a viewer should absorb all the information in your banner at a glance without having to make the decision to read it.</p><p>Keep your text to your channel name and one additional line underneath, if you can. Make sure your additional line of text is smaller than your channel name, so they aren’t competing.</p><p><strong>Use Images and Colors that Suit Your Channel</strong></p><p>If you have an upbeat, positive, channel then a black and red banner with skulls on it might not be the best choice to convey that. Similarly, if you have a gaming channel, then a minimalist banner that includes an Instagram-worthy picture of you wearing the latest seasonal styles might send the wrong message. It will make the viewer that sees it think you have a lifestyle channel, and they may click away thinking the Let’s Play they just watched was a one-off.</p><p>Look at the kinds of colors and images other YouTubers in your niche are using for inspiration for what you should do, but also consider the unique message of your channel. If you consider yourself bold, use bolder colors. If your videos have a more relaxed vibe, something softer might make sense.</p><p>Here’s a guide to what people tend to associate with different colors:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-implication.jpg"                      alt="color-implication"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Include Your Face</strong></p><p>This isn’t essential for every type of channel. If you mostly post gaming content or screencast tutorials and you don’t appear much in your actual videos, there’s no need to appear in your banner.</p><p>However, if your channel is primarily about you as a personality, then including your face in your channel art can have a lot of benefits. People are automatically drawn in by eye contact and feel more connected when they can see a face. Besides just looking good, including your face in your banner can help build a relationship with new viewers and make them feel more comfortable subscribing. They’ll know they’re subscribing to a person, not just a channel.</p><p><strong>Give Viewers a Reason to Subscribe</strong></p><p>Someone who has chosen to check out your channel page is already thinking about subscribing, but they didn’t do it from the video page because they want to know a bit more about you. The things they are probably hoping to find out are:</p><ol><li>Do you have more videos like that one they just watched? Will you make more?</li><li>Are you ever going to post again?</li></ol><p>There are a lot of YouTubers that just give up at some point, or who have started a channel but don’t have time to post very often. That you might never post a new video again, or might not post one for so long that the new subscriber forgets who you are, is a real hesitation viewer can have about subscribing.</p><p>Viewers also want to know that when you do post again, the video you post will be something they like. If they liked the video, they found you through because it was funny, but there’s nothing on your channel page that suggests you do comedy videos regularly, then that can make someone think twice. If you subscribe because of a makeup tutorial, but then the creator only posts personal vlogs from then on, it can be disappointing.</p><p>By clearly stating what kinds of videos you make and when you post them in your banner, you are giving viewers a reason to subscribe.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p><em>“Vlogs &amp; Comedy! New videos every Tuesday.”</em></p><p><em>“Two videos every week! Makeup Mondays and Fashion Fridays”</em></p><p>If you can create channel art that has a layout that makes sense and sends a clear message even at a glance, then that will help you look like a more experienced YouTuber.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134230/18498" target="_top" id="2134230">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134230" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134230/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Channel-Art-Inspiration"><a href="#Channel-Art-Inspiration" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Inspiration"></a><strong>Channel Art Inspiration</strong></h2><p>Sometimes your niche on YouTube will determine what kinds of channel art you should use. For example, it makes sense for gamers to include game-related graphics in their banners and for travel vloggers to use photos from the destinations they’ve visited.</p><p>However, for lots of YouTube niches, the channel art you make will be built around your personality. How do you know what fits your personality? Here’s some inspiration based on popular trends.</p><p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-minimalism.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-minimalism"                ></p><p>This is an example of a minimalist YouTube banner. This style typically uses only 2 or 3 colors and features clean lines, simple backgrounds, and not a lot of noise. If you want to project a calm, tidy, balanced vibe on your channel, then you should consider going in a minimalist direction with your banner.</p><p>This example is light and airy, but you can also create a minimalist look using brighter or darker colors. It just depends on your personality.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Themed</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-galaxy-themed.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-galaxy-themed"                ></p><p>Galaxy banners are exactly what they sound like: channel art featuring space scenes or photographs of the night sky. At first glance, you might think they belong with channels that talk about science or sci-fi, and they are great for that, but they’re also a fun choice for comedy, vlogging, or gaming.</p><p>The great thing about the galaxy style is that it’s cool and different, but it doesn’t take over and distract from your message. There is a lot of room for a space scene to be very personalized. The example above is bold and purple. You can find galaxy photos in just about any color, and they can be either bright like this one or quite dark.</p><p><strong>Funky</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-Funky.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-Funky"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>There isn’t really one ‘funky’ style. A funky banner is anything that’s just a little off-beat but still makes sense while you’re looking at it. They tend to be bright and cheerful and are perfect for anyone who considers themselves a bit quirky.</p><p>If you’re looking for inspiration for a custom funky banner, go to your closet and find your favorite funny, cute, or ironic t-shirt. There’s probably something in its design you can bring into your channel art.</p><p><strong>Comic</strong></p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-comic.jpg" alt="/text-and-logo-comic"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>A banner featuring an actual comic book character probably belongs to a channel that discusses comics, but the style itself is great for just about anyone. It’s bold and communicates confidence. If your attitude towards YouTube is that you want to be fearless, why not go for something worthy of a superhuman?</p><p>Do you have any of your own tips to share about YouTube banners?</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.

You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links.

These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video.

If you want to follow up or reply to such comments, you can do so from your email or YouTube Dashboard.</p><p>If you click the notification bell icon, whenever a viewer drops a new comment on one of your videos, YouTube will send you a notification via email. On opening the email, you will find a clickable “Reply” option. Or else, if you follow the comment section in the YouTube Dashboard, you can directly view or reply to highlighted comments from here as well.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why a highlighted comment always shows at the top of the comment list? Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it.

The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously).

The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123901/26106" target="_top" id="2123901">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123901" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123901/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial. That is especially true if you are looking for ways to optimize your channel.</p><p>YouTube is undeniably the second largest search engine on the web. Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel. If your comment gets highlighted, your YouTube channel can be one of them.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>YouTube can be an intimidating tool for marketing and more so for newcomers. Every YouTuber wishes that their channel performs better than the previous day. Even though the highlighted comment or highlighted reply feature doesn’t have any direct benefits, it can indeed help in optimizing your YouTube channel.</p><p>It can connect you with potential viewers and increase the number of people that visit your channel regularly. However, how many of them stay and hit the “Subscribe” button is a different story altogether and is wholly based on whether they like what you share through your videos.</p><p>In this article, we have shared facts on YouTube’s commonly seen highlighted comment feature. Yet, the term is a heavily misleading one, as far as viewers and Youtuber’s are concerned. We have also covered all other aspects and queries related to this term.

You get entertained and also have a chance to share your videos with the world. Among the popular apps are TikTok and Shorts. TikTok got to the market earlier but has so far found a new competitor in the field. Shorts video has now fully emerged from YouTube and has almost the same playing ground. But it is still unclear whether <strong>YouTube Shorts and TikTok</strong> are comparable. While TikTok has over 2 billion downloads, YouTube, on the other hand, already has a massive audience for the tough tussle.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts give both creators and viewers the chance to share short videos for entertainment and promotional purposes. However, they are different in various aspects. Both the apps have their disadvantages and advantages, depending on a user’s preference. Dive into the next section to discover whether TikTok’s impact is about to be threatened by YouTube Shorts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shorts-tiktok-compare.png"                      alt="compare youtube shorts with tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?"></a>Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</h2><p>Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.</p><p>They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage"><a href="#YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?"></a>YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</h2><p>Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.</p><h3 id="Similiarity"><a href="#Similiarity" class="headerlink" title="- Similiarity"></a>- Similiarity</h3><p>Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.</p><h5 id="1-Monetization"><a href="#1-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="1) Monetization"></a>1) Monetization</h5><p>Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content. TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.</p><h5 id="2-Analytics"><a href="#2-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="2) Analytics"></a>2) Analytics</h5><p>Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.</p><h5 id="3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators"><a href="#3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators" class="headerlink" title="3) Subscribe directly to creators"></a>3) Subscribe directly to creators</h5><p>You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.</p><h5 id="4-Privacy"><a href="#4-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="4) Privacy"></a>4) Privacy</h5><p>Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.</p><h5 id="5-Edit-video"><a href="#5-Edit-video" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit video"></a>5) Edit video</h5><p>There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.</p><h3 id="Difference"><a href="#Difference" class="headerlink" title="- Difference"></a>- Difference</h3><h5 id="1-Instant-messaging-app"><a href="#1-Instant-messaging-app" class="headerlink" title="1) Instant messaging app"></a>1) Instant messaging app</h5><p>Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.</p><h5 id="2-In-dependability"><a href="#2-In-dependability" class="headerlink" title="2) In dependability"></a>2) In dependability</h5><p>TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.</p><h5 id="3-Interface"><a href="#3-Interface" class="headerlink" title="3) Interface"></a>3) Interface</h5><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><h3 id="What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need"><a href="#What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need" class="headerlink" title="- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need"></a>- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need</h3><p>Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste.

You get entertained and also have a chance to share your videos with the world. Among the popular apps are TikTok and Shorts. TikTok got to the market earlier but has so far found a new competitor in the field. Shorts video has now fully emerged from YouTube and has almost the same playing ground. But it is still unclear whether <strong>YouTube Shorts and TikTok</strong> are comparable. While TikTok has over 2 billion downloads, YouTube, on the other hand, already has a massive audience for the tough tussle.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts give both creators and viewers the chance to share short videos for entertainment and promotional purposes. However, they are different in various aspects. Both the apps have their disadvantages and advantages, depending on a user’s preference. Dive into the next section to discover whether TikTok’s impact is about to be threatened by YouTube Shorts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shorts-tiktok-compare.png"                      alt="compare youtube shorts with tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</a></p><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing-3"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing-3" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?"></a>Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</h2><p>Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.</p><p>They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage-3"><a href="#YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?"></a>YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</h2><p>Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.</p><h3 id="Similiarity-3"><a href="#Similiarity-3" class="headerlink" title="- Similiarity"></a>- Similiarity</h3><p>Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.</p><h5 id="1-Monetization-3"><a href="#1-Monetization-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Monetization"></a>1) Monetization</h5><p>Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content. TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.</p><h5 id="2-Analytics-3"><a href="#2-Analytics-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Analytics"></a>2) Analytics</h5><p>Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.</p><h5 id="3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators-3"><a href="#3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Subscribe directly to creators"></a>3) Subscribe directly to creators</h5><p>You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.</p><h5 id="4-Privacy-3"><a href="#4-Privacy-3" class="headerlink" title="4) Privacy"></a>4) Privacy</h5><p>Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.</p><h5 id="5-Edit-video-3"><a href="#5-Edit-video-3" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit video"></a>5) Edit video</h5><p>There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.</p><h3 id="Difference-3"><a href="#Difference-3" class="headerlink" title="- Difference"></a>- Difference</h3><h5 id="1-Instant-messaging-app-3"><a href="#1-Instant-messaging-app-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Instant messaging app"></a>1) Instant messaging app</h5><p>Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.</p><h5 id="2-In-dependability-3"><a href="#2-In-dependability-3" class="headerlink" title="2) In dependability"></a>2) In dependability</h5><p>TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.</p><h5 id="3-Interface-3"><a href="#3-Interface-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Interface"></a>3) Interface</h5><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982596">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982596">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982596%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982596/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need-3"><a href="#What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need-3" class="headerlink" title="- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need"></a>- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need</h3><p>Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music.

When someone leaves a mean, negative comment on one of your videos it will likely affect you. It may make you angry, hurt your feelings, or just leave you baffled over how someone could come away from your video with out-of-the-blue opinion the hater has posted. ‘Do not feed the trolls’ is a mantra that can be hard to abide by. This article will explain why you should not engage trolls and how to talk to them if you find yourself doing it anyways.</p><h2 id="How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube"></a>How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube</h2><h4 id="1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll"><a href="#1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll" class="headerlink" title="1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?"></a>1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?</h4><p> The internet is full of trolls and if you continue making YouTube videos – especially videos that get a lot of views – then you are sure to be attacked by a few. Or, alternatively, a troll may attack your other viewers in the comments of your videos. It is extremely easy to be a troll and so there are a lot of them.</p><p> Most trolls are easy to spot. They leave comments designed to hurt you or make you angry, often using over-the-top offensive language. Not all trolls are so obvious, though. Some trolls will be nice at first – flatteringly nice, even – and it will take a few comments before they turn on you or your subscribers. They want you to like them so you put more stock in what they are saying later and take longer to start ignoring them. Some trolls will even go back to being nice to reel you back in.</p><p> It is important to remember that not everybody who leaves negative comments on YouTube videos is a troll. Step back from your emotional reaction to a comment and make sure there is really nothing constructive in it before you dismiss it. Some people have nasty ways of expressing legitimate opinions, and sometimes even when there is no decipherable meaning behind a rude comment the person is not trying to troll you. Some people just have poor communication skills. For example, if someone leaves a comment on your video that consists of only the word ‘bad’ you cannot know for sure what they meant. It could be that they are agreeing with something you mentioned disliking in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls"><a href="#2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls" class="headerlink" title="2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls"></a>2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls</h4><p> Trolls are bored and looking for attention. When you respond, they win. You may think you are demonstrating to them that they were out of line, or logically proving them wrong, but the troll does not care. Your outraged responses are what trolls want and will only entertain them.</p><p> Also, trolls do not care if they are wrong. They almost always seem to think that their opinions are the only ones that count for anything, but quite often their opinions are not even their real opinions. Chances are they do not actually believe anything they are saying to you they just know what to say to make you mad. Remember that you will always be more invested in any interaction you have with a troll than they are. For them it is a game and they cannot lose because they do not really care. If you take the bait it’s fun, and if you do not then they will move on to a target that will. Even if you put hours of effort into chasing off a troll and manage to make them go away they will have enjoyed the whole thing and you will be left exhausted.</p><h4 id="3-But-If-You-Do…"><a href="#3-But-If-You-Do…" class="headerlink" title="3. But If You Do…"></a>3. But If You Do…</h4><p> While you should avoid talking to trolls, sometimes you cannot. Trolls occasionally start off making kind comments or asking legitimate questions to lure you in. You might be a couple comments into a conversation before a troll reveals their true colors.</p><p> There are also times when you respond even though you know you should not because you just cannot let a specific rude comment go unanswered. It is easy to say you should never feed the trolls, but a lot of people cannot help it. If you find yourself engaging a troll there are a few things you can do to try and manage the situation.</p><p> First, avoid using any emotional language; they love that. Keep your responses either pleasantly detached or dry and factual. Say what you feel you need to say and ask the troll for more information. If the troll has made a false claim then ask them for evidence as if you are genuinely interested in learning more. It is highly unlikely they will be able to provide any, although they may make something up. If the troll has made a blanket statement about how terrible they think you are then pretend you either value their input or find them funny and ask them to explain. They will either leave or respond with more insults.</p><p> You will not get the troll to say they were wrong or apologize so that should never be your goal. What you can do is create a public record of the troll being corrected for others to judge for themselves.

With nothing to reflect your image, you won’t find any optical viewfinder to look through to see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>Light passes through the lens of a mirrorless camera and lands directly onto the camera’s sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best Mirrorless Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison</h2><h4 id="Size-and-Weight"><a href="#Size-and-Weight" class="headerlink" title="Size and Weight"></a>Size and Weight</h4><p>DSLR cameras are larger and heavier than mirrorless cameras because there are more parts that go into their camera bodies. DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.</p><p>If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="Previewing-Images"><a href="#Previewing-Images" class="headerlink" title="Previewing Images"></a>Previewing Images</h4><p>When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up. No matter how bright or dark your scene actually is, through the optical viewfinder, you’ll be able to clearly see what your camera sees with the power of your eye.</p><p>Mirrorless cameras, on the other hand, display on your camera’s screen or electronic viewfinder a digital preview of what your camera is looking at. You will notice a lag, especially in low light, between actions that are taking place in front of the camera and the same actions being displayed in your live preview.</p><h4 id="Lenses-and-Accessories"><a href="#Lenses-and-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Lenses and Accessories"></a>Lenses and Accessories</h4><p>Having been around much longer, there are plenty more options for lenses and accessories when it comes to shooting with DSLR cameras. You can choose from all kinds of different quality levels and price ranges.</p><h4 id="Video-Resolution"><a href="#Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Video Resolution"></a>Video Resolution</h4><p>4K video recording is more readily available in mirrorless cameras than DSLR cameras. At a much more affordable budget, you can get your hands on a 4K mirrorless camera. If you want to shoot 4K video on a DSLR camera, though, you will have to pay for some of the most expensive DSLR cameras on the market.</p><h4 id="Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization"></a>Image Stabilization</h4><p>Up until quite recently, you needed to get the right lens with built-in optical image stabilization if you wanted to shoot stabilized photos and videos with an interchangeable lens camera. Image stabilization had not been readily available in the bodies of these cameras.</p><p>In recent years, however, mirrorless cameras have been much more active in their development of camera bodies equipped with shifting image sensors. Your shots can be even more stabilized when the optical image stabilization of your lens is combined with your camera’s in-body sensor-shift image stabilization.</p><h4 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p>When it comes to shooting video, DSLR cameras and mirrorless cameras consume about the same amount of power. It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135358/19272" target="_top" id="2135358">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135358" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135358/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?</h2><p>In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go.

If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.</p><h4 id="Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit"><a href="#Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit"></a>Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit</h4><p>The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube’s blog and Google’s 2011 upload rules.

Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Bouns!

The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you’re adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you’ve ever wondered.

It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Bouns!

The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you’re adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you’ve ever wondered. On the surface, posting songs to YouTube may appear complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it’ll be a snap. When considering how to promote your music, YouTube should not be disregarded. It’s rare to have a free platform to distribute music on, so make use of it. With such a massive YouTube user base, your potential audience is enormous. Get your song on the platform and promote it as much as possible. You never know who might come upon your tunes until you’ve made them public. This concluded the tutorial on how to upload music to YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-quick-tips-for-saving-and-storing-vimeo-videos/"><u>[New] Quick Tips for Saving and Storing Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-optimize-your-content-searchability-with-these-7-top-tier-youtube-tags-extractor-tools/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Optimize Your Content Searchability with These 7 Top-Tier Youtube Tags Extractor Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-chuckle-chronicles-top-youtube-humorists-masterpieces-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Chuckle Chronicles Top YouTube Humorists' Masterpieces for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-expert-tips-for-fixing-non-displaying-shorts-thumbnails/"><u>[Updated] Expert Tips for Fixing Non-Displaying Shorts Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-monetization-metrics-viewers-contribution-to-earnings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Monetization Metrics Viewers' Contribution to Earnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/approved-cutting-edge-science-education-through-yt-channels/"><u>2024 Approved Cutting Edge Science Education Through YT Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/exploring-chatgpts-skills-a-guide-to-virtual-cocktail-creation/"><u>Exploring ChatGPT's Skills: A Guide to Virtual Cocktail Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-art-of-extended-frame-videos-on-iphone/"><u>In 2024, The Art of Extended Frame Videos on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-advanced-visuals-how-to-use-picture-in-picture-in-final-cut-pro/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Advanced Visuals How to Use Picture-in-Picture in Final Cut Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/new-how-to-define-ai-video/"><u>New How to Define AI Video?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/unlicensed-zen-audio-streaming-for-2024/"><u>Unlicensed Zen Audio Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/king-high-quality-videos-youtubes-enhancement-secrets-revealed/"><u>Unlocking High-Quality Videos YouTube's Enhancement Secrets Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/will-pokemon-go-ban-the-account-if-you-use-pgsharp-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12t-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

More than 5 billion videos are watched every single minute on YouTube. And the ever-growing user base has propelled YouTube to the status of 2nd most popular social media platform in the world, and the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >second most visited website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after Google in 2021.</p><p>YouTube marketing is great for both businesses and individuals who want to make careers out of YouTube. Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p><p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p><h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p><h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p><p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p><p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p><h3 id="c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts"><a href="#c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts" class="headerlink" title="c.

On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p><p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p><p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers.

Sign in to YouTube Studio Beta and the click Reach from the Analytics menu provided on the left panel. Now click on Traffic source types.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Analytics"                ></p><p>In this window, you can see the different sources that led viewers to your video. Generally, it can be a mix of websites, YouTube recommendation’s, YouTube search, etc. Metrics like Watch Time gives you an idea of how long viewers watch your videos and Audience Retention shows how consistent they are at watching them. These are just two of the many metrics you can use to your advantage.</p><p>Analyzing YouTube videos will help you structure your future videos in a way that it is more susceptible to being clicked.</p><h2 id="Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos"><a href="#Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos"></a><strong>Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos</strong></h2><p>You must have an eye on the metrics that your videos garner over the days.

Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p><p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort. Having a rank tracker like the one from <a class="link"   href="https://seranking.com/position-tracking.html" >SE Ranking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/tools#keywordranktracking" >Tubebuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be quite handy at times like these.

The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p><p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p><p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p><p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort.

How else can you share your channel? In this article, we are trying to give you a thorough understanding of the YouTube Channel URL and tell you how to get the custom channel URL.</p><h2 id="Types-of-YouTube-Channel-URL"><a href="#Types-of-YouTube-Channel-URL" class="headerlink" title="Types of YouTube Channel URL"></a>Types of YouTube Channel URL</h2><p><strong>ID-based URL</strong></p><p>YouTube channel URL of this type is based on your channel ID, which consists of numbers and letters. This is the URL of the universal form. For example, “youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;specific YouTube channel ID”.</p><p>You can <strong>find the YouTube channel URL</strong> of this kind by the following steps.</p><ol><li>Sign in to Youtube.com and click on your profile icon.</li><li>Select Your Channel.</li><li>Find the URL on the address bar of your browser. This is exactly the ID-based URL or the standard URL of your channel.</li></ol><p><strong>Legacy username URL</strong></p><p>Legacy username URL was used by YouTube in the past. If you created your channel in the early days of YouTube, the URL for your channel might contain the username at the end. Although YouTube doesn’t apply username to forming channel URL anymore, you can still use this URL to direct to Your channel. But you should note that the exiting username can’t be changed even if you have changed your channel name. For example, “youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;specific YouTube channel ID”.</p><p>You can share the short form of the username URL with the “<strong>&#x2F;user</strong>“ being left out, such as “youtube.com&#x2F;specific YouTube channel ID”. But this may not be available if someone claimed to a custom URL whose short form is the same with the short form of your username URL.</p><p><strong>Custom URL</strong></p><p>This is a shorter and more easy-to-remember URL that is generated on the basis of your current display name, legacy username, or your linked and verified domain. You can claim for the custom URL if your channel meets certain qualifications.</p><p>The custom URL looks like this, “youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;display name, legacy username, or your linked and verified domain”. You can also share this URL in its shorter form by leaving out the “<strong>&#x2F;c</strong>“, for example, “youtube.com&#x2F;customed part”.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-a-Custom-URL-for-your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-Custom-URL-for-your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a Custom URL for your YouTube Channel"></a><strong>How to Get a Custom URL for your YouTube Channel</strong></h2><p>To qualify for a custom URL – one which includes your channel name instead of a random sequence of letters, your channel needs to meet the following standards.</p><ul><li>Be at least 30 days old</li><li>Have at least 100 subscribers</li><li>Use a photo for the channel icon</li><li>Have uploaded channel art</li></ul><p>As long as your account meets these eligibility standards, then you can go over the following steps to claim a custom URL for your YouTube channel.</p><ol><li>Start by signing into YouTube.</li><li>Click on your profile image on the top right of the screen.</li><li>Find the “settings” and click on it.</li><li>Select “Advanced settings”.</li><li>Click on the link anchored with the word “here”.</li><li>The “Get a custom URL” box will then pop out. You can select one from the approved options. You may need to add a suffix to make the URL of your channel to be unique.</li><li>Read the “Terms of use” carefully and then click on the <strong>change URL</strong>.</li></ol><p>Custom YouTube channel URLs are easier for your fans to remember, but once you have one, you can never change it. Your existing subscribers will automatically redirect to your new URL if they try to get to your channel through the old URL.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-Your-Custom-URL-Once-You-Successfully-Claimed-for-It"><a href="#Where-to-Find-Your-Custom-URL-Once-You-Successfully-Claimed-for-It" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find Your Custom URL Once You Successfully Claimed for It?"></a>Where to Find Your <strong>Custom URL Once You Successfully Claimed for It?</strong></h2><p>After you successfully get the custom URL, you may want to know where you can find the custom URL and therefore you can share it anywhere you like. The way to find your custom URL is exactly the same as how you created it. You can get back to the “Advanced settings” by following the above-mentioned steps. You’ll find the custom URL lies right there under your user ID and channel ID.</p><p>Who read this article also read:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Good YouTube Names Generators + How to Brainstorm&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a YouTube Subscribe Link - Easy!&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.
