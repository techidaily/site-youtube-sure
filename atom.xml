Plus, it is an easy way to disguise the room you are vlogging from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-blur01.JPG"                      alt="how to blur01"                ></p><p>Even if your set is clean, there could be things like books behind you, which will distract viewers; they will be trying to read the spines. Blurring out the background of your shot makes your video look polished and keeps people’s focus entirely on you.</p><ul><li><a href="#blur_background_in_video_shooting">Part 1: Blur YouTube Video Background in Shooting Videos</a></li><li><a href="#blur_background_in_video_editing">Part 2: Add Tilt-Shift Effects to Video in Editing</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-of-Your-YouTube-Video-in-Shooting-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-of-Your-YouTube-Video-in-Shooting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos"></a>Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos</h2><p>Blurring your background is also how you create a beautiful bokeh lighting effect. Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f&#x2F;3 or f&#x2F;4 can also work.</p><p>Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject&#x2F;depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.</p><h2 id="Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor</h2><p>If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production. Here, I will show you how to do that in Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers. Its user-friendly interface and tutorial guide enables green-hands to start video editing quickly. Besides, you can find many free filters, effects, and elements pre-programmed, so you can use them directly without looking for presets and templates somewhere else.</p><h3 id="1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora"><a href="#1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Add Bokeh Filter to Video in Filmora"></a>1. Add Bokeh Filter to Video in Filmora</h3><p>There are about 20 bokeh effects available in filters and overlays. You can find them easily by typing bokeh in the search bar in Effects.</p><p>Note: you should select <strong>Included</strong> to see all bokeh effects pre-programmed in Filmora. If you need more visual effects, just go to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Filmstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> effects store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-bokeh-effect.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Bokeh effect"                ></p><p>Double click the bokeh effect to preview the result, and if you find the bokeh effect fits the video, just drop it to the track above the video. And the bokeh filter or overlay will be applied to the video automatically.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Tilt-Shift-Circle-Linear-Effect-to-Blur-Video-Background"><a href="#2-Use-Tilt-Shift-Circle-Linear-Effect-to-Blur-Video-Background" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Tilt-Shift Circle&#x2F;Linear Effect to Blur Video Background"></a>2. Use Tilt-Shift Circle&#x2F;Linear Effect to Blur Video Background</h3><p>Filmora features two tilt effects, tilt-shift circle and tilt-shift linear, which allows you to highlight people in the video, blur, and conceal the video background.</p><p>Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and then switch to the <strong>Utility</strong> menu under <strong>Included</strong> category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tilt-shift-effects.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Tilt-Shift effects"                ></p><p>Here, I will select the <strong>Tilt-Shift Circle</strong> effect and drop it to the track above the video. Now, you can adjust the size, position, and intensity of the tilt-shift circle effect</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-tilt-shift-circle-effect.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Tilt-Shift Circle effect"                ></p><p>You see, the video background is blurred, and the people are highlighted. Now it’s your turn to download the Filmora video editor and try it yourself.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-bring-your-videos-to-life-best-dvd-creation-software-for-beginners-for-2024/"><u>Updated Bring Your Videos to Life Best DVD Creation Software for Beginners for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-master-adding-youtube-videos-to-gslides-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Master Adding YouTube Videos to GSlides  A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/paving-the-way-to-youtube-stardom-through-effective-seo-keywords/"><u>Paving the Way to YouTube Stardom Through Effective SEO Keywords</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-maximizing-reach-strategies-from-seasoned-tubebuddy-experts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Maximizing Reach  Strategies From Seasoned TubeBuddy Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-mediamasher-deluxe/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  MediaMasher Deluxe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-viewer-response-crafting-engaging-ig-story-qandas/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Viewer Response  Crafting Engaging IG Story Q&As</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>2 Ways to Transfer Text Messages from Samsung Galaxy A15 5G to iPhone 15/14/13/12/11/X/8/ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-rapid-access-accelerating-vimeo-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Rapid Access  Accelerating Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-best-top-timelapses-quick-capture-and-edit-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Top Timelapses  Quick Capture & Edit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-keep-it-legal-how-to-convert-youtube-to-mp4-safely/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Keep It Legal  How to Convert YouTube to MP4 Safely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-delete-gmail-account-withwithout-password-on-nokia-c32-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Delete Gmail Account With/Without Password On Nokia C32</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-mastering-video-spin-a-comprehensive-2023-users-guide-to-youtube-angles/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Video Spin  A Comprehensive 2023 User's Guide to YouTube Angles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-innovators-crafting-marvels-digital-realm/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Innovators Crafting Marvel's Digital Realm</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-instantaneous-pro-thumbnail-creation-valorant-edition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Instantaneous Pro Thumbnail Creation -

This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p><p><strong>4.

This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p><p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p><h4 id="See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue"><a href="#See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue"></a><strong>See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue</strong></h4><p>Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.</p><p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/monetized-videos.jpg"                      alt="monetized-videos"                >  </p><h4 id="See-How-Each-Ad-Type-Is-Performing-Within-Individual-Video"><a href="#See-How-Each-Ad-Type-Is-Performing-Within-Individual-Video" class="headerlink" title="See How Each Ad Type Is Performing Within Individual Video"></a><strong>See How Each Ad Type Is Performing Within Individual Video</strong></h4><p>Click into Ad Type and you will be able to see the performance of <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en" >different types of Ads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (skippable video ads, display ads, bumper ads, and non-skippable video ads.)</p><p>You can see these details from the channel level or from an individual video level.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ad-type-within-individual-video.jpg"                      alt="ad-type-within-individual-video"                >  </p><h4 id="How-to-Use-Ad-Rates-Report"><a href="#How-to-Use-Ad-Rates-Report" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Ad Rates Report"></a><strong>How to Use Ad Rates Report</strong></h4><p>Ad performance might not be something you think about at the early stages. You want to make videos, and not worry too much about ads, after all.</p><p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p><p><strong>5. Watch Time</strong></p><h4 id="See-The-Aggregated-Time-Your-Viewers-Spent-Watching-Your-Videos"><a href="#See-The-Aggregated-Time-Your-Viewers-Spent-Watching-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on this metric because they know that the more time people spend watching your original content, the more time they will have to show ads to your audience. Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/the-aggregated-time.jpg"                      alt="the-aggregated-time"                >  </p><p>In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.</p><p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p><p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p><h4 id="Compare-Performance-of-Videos-in-the-Graph"><a href="#Compare-Performance-of-Videos-in-the-Graph" class="headerlink" title="Compare Performance of Videos in the Graph"></a><strong>Compare Performance of Videos in the Graph</strong></h4><p>Put your videos side by side to compare the performance over the course of a time period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/performance-of-videos-in-the-graph.jpg"                      alt="performance-of-videos-in-the-graph"                >  </p><h4 id="How-to-Use-Watch-Time-Report"><a href="#How-to-Use-Watch-Time-Report" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Watch Time Report"></a><strong>How to Use Watch Time Report</strong></h4><p>If you want to be in YouTube’s algorithm’s good books, then you will need to put some attention on your channel’s Watch Time. Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p><p>Some strategies include:</p><p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p><p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p><p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p><p>- Add annotations to your videos</p><p>- Add end cards to your videos</p><p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p><h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p><p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p><ol><li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li><li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li></ol><p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p><p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/average-view-duration.jpg"                      alt="average-view-duration"                >  </p><h4 id="See-Audience-Retention-of-Individual-Videos"><a href="#See-Audience-Retention-of-Individual-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See Audience Retention of Individual Videos"></a><strong>See Audience Retention of Individual Videos</strong></h4><p><strong>Absolute Audience Retention:</strong> This report shows you the number of views at every point in the video as a percentage.

When you visit YouTube after installing TubeBuddy a whole new set of useful tools becomes available.</p><p>TubeBuddy’s tools were designed to save you time and effort when performing some of the more mundane tasks involved in running a YouTube channel, like adding cards. Many of TubeBuddy’s tools are completely free to use, but others might require a paid license. There are three levels of licensing: $9, $19, or $39 per month.</p><h4 id="The-Benefits-of-Using-TubeBuddy-for-YouTube"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Using-TubeBuddy-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Using TubeBuddy for YouTube"></a>The Benefits of Using TubeBuddy for YouTube</h4><ol><li><a href="#productivity"><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></a></li><li><a href="#bulk"><strong>Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More</strong></a></li><li><a href="#tags"><strong>Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#data"><strong>Useful Data</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Benefits-of-TubeBuddy"><a href="#Benefits-of-TubeBuddy" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of TubeBuddy"></a><strong>Benefits of TubeBuddy</strong></h2><p>YouTubers who use TubeBuddy are able to spend less time on busy-work and more time on coming up with creative video ideas. Here are some of the ways TubeBuddy can help you, especially if you have a large or mid-sized channel:</p><h4 id="1-Increased-Productivity"><a href="#1-Increased-Productivity" class="headerlink" title="1. Increased Productivity"></a><strong>1. Increased Productivity</strong></h4><p>Most of TubeBuddy’s Productivity Tools are available for free, but some require a $9 per month Pro license.</p><p>You can use these tools to get your videos ready for posting faster, embed them off-YouTube more easily, and save time by creating canned responses or templates for cards and annotations.</p><p>For example, you might find yourself creating the same YouTube Card over and over again to include it in every video you make. Creating a template through TubeBuddy will save you this effort.</p><p>Another great productivity tool is the Video Topic Planner. You can save video ideas you come up with, or ideas viewers have suggested to you, and arrange them in a queue so you never forget what you are planning to make next.</p><h4 id="2-Bulk-Tools-for-Annotations-Cards-Thumbnails-and-More"><a href="#2-Bulk-Tools-for-Annotations-Cards-Thumbnails-and-More" class="headerlink" title="2. Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More"></a><strong>2. Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More</strong></h4><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubebuddy-bulk-tools.jpg"                      alt="TubeBuddy bulk tools"                ></strong></p><p>Most of TubeBuddy’s bulk processing tools require a $19 per month Star license.</p><p>Two of the most time-saving tools in this section are the Bulk Copy tools for cards and annotations. They will save you from having to recreate the same ones over and over. Then, using the Bulk Update tools, you will be able to make changes to all of your cards or annotations at once.</p><p>For example: if you use a YouTube Card to link to your personal website and include it in every video, and then you change your website, you change the link in all of your existing cards at once.</p><p>Another useful Bulk tool is Bulk Thumbnail Overlays, which will allow you to add a logo to all of your existing video thumbnails at once.</p><h4 id="3-Quick-Optimization-for-Your-Video’s-Tags"><a href="#3-Quick-Optimization-for-Your-Video’s-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags"></a><strong>3. Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags</strong></h4><p>The SEO Tools in TubeBuddy will help you find the best tags for your videos and suggest tags you might want to target. Many of these tools are free, but others require a $19 Star license.</p><p>One of the best free tools in this category is View and Copy Video Tags. It allows you to see and copy the tags of other people’s videos. You will be able to see which keywords your competitors are targeting (and look for opportunities to target them more effectively). This can also save you a lot of time writing out tags that should really be the same as the ones on an existing video.</p><h4 id="4-Useful-Data"><a href="#4-Useful-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Useful Data"></a><strong>4. Useful Data</strong></h4><p>The most useful piece of data under Data and Research Tools is the Best Time to Publish. How many views you get on a video could vary greatly depending on when you post, and the best times to post vary depending on the demographics of your audience. This free tool from TubeBuddy will show you when you should be uploading.</p><p>Another interesting tool, which is unfortunately only available with $39 licenses, is the Competitor Scoreboard. It allows creators to compare their channels stats to those of their rival channels.</p><p> Have you ever tried TubeBuddy for YouTube?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-make-sense-of-iphone-video-repetition-tech/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Make Sense of iPhone Video Repetition Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-mastering-market-movements-with-youtube-picks/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Market Movements with YouTube Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/what-is-an-ai-artist-in-2024/"><u>What Is an AI Artist, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-apple-iphone-11-pro-to-zte-phones-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to ZTE Phones | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-mastering-collab-videos-to-expand-viewership/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Collab Videos to Expand Viewership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-implementing-custom-overlays-in-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Implementing Custom Overlays in YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-art-of-frequency-shifting-without-compromising-clarity-in-audacity/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Art of Frequency Shifting Without Compromising Clarity in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-leading-audience-alteration-software-selection/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Leading Audience Alteration Software Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-innovative-editing-methods-for-yt-videos-with-windows-movie-maker/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Innovative Editing Methods for YT Videos with Windows Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-locked-out-of-iphone-14-5-ways-to-get-into-a-locked-iphone-14-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Locked Out of iPhone 14?

With so much competition on the platform, it’s crucial that you stand out from the crowd with efficient, professional videos that are a pleasure to watch.</p><p> Without some planning and structure in mind before you begin filming, it’s all too easy to get a bit lost and start to ramble or fumble your words. Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p><p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p><ul><li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li><li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li><li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li></ul><p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p><h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p><p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p><h3 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p><ol><li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li></ol><p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p><ol><li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li></ol><p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p><p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p><h3 id="Hook"><a href="#Hook" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p><p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p><h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be. We call this a ‘call to action’, and it could eb something as simple as subscribing through to something more involved like visiting your website.</p><p> Think about what you want from your audience; what should they do next? Remember to ask via a strong call to action, otherwise you’ve simply given them some free advice with very little in the way of a return for you.</p><h3 id="Script-or-no-script"><a href="#Script-or-no-script" class="headerlink" title="Script or no script?"></a>Script or no script?</h3><p> Many YouTubers shy away from using any sort of script, feeling that this will make them less relatable and natural. Choosing whether or not to script is entirely up to you; some people feel more comfortable with a script to hand, whereas others prefer to just wing it as they go.</p><p> If you don’t feel a script would work for you, do consider having a very rough outline of your structure and the points you want to make readily available while filming. It will help you regain control if you do happen to lose your place and will ensure you get all the information across that you’d planned to.</p><p> If you do think a full script would work better for you, make sure you are able to come across as naturally as possible while reading it. Write your script the same way you speak and run through a few times so you’re not squinting at words while you’re on camera. If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Loop a YouTube Video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos"><a href="#Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos" class="headerlink" title="Ready to go out and make amazing videos?"></a>Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</h2><p> Having a structure to your videos might seem a little unnatural at first, but there’s plenty of evidence to show that people who take the time to plan their content get far better results than those who just improvise. If you’re unsure of the best structure for your content, watch videos made by others in your niche to see how they organize theirs.</p><p> That’s not to say you have to copy the leaders to be a success; indeed, you’ll be far more successful on YouTube if you continue to be unique. But there’s always room to learn from the best and to take inspiration from those who’ve been getting the very best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload

I’m a Social Worker, which means I’m always juggling my time between conducting home visits, returning phone calls and emails, and round-the-clock documentation on my clients. YouTube can be a great source of passive income, but it takes time before you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization---the-ultimate-guide-to-ad-revenue-422.html" >make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>I’ve had to put a lot of effort into staying consistent with my YouTube channel. Through trial and error, I’ve learned some things that have worked tremendously, while others have been epic fails.</p><p>So, to save you and your viewers some of the same struggles, here are 5 tips I recommend for keeping your channel running successfully and having work-life balance!</p><p><a href="#specificdays">1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days</a></p><p><a href="#notebook">2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner</a></p><p><a href="#weather">3. Check the weather forecast in advance</a></p><p><a href="#createvideos">4. Create 3-5 videos in advance</a></p><p><a href="#createaudio">5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)</a></p><h2 id="1-Don’t-force-yourself-to-post-on-specific-days"><a href="#1-Don’t-force-yourself-to-post-on-specific-days" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days"></a>1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days</h2><p>I know what you’re thinking - “What?! That’s insane.” The first piece of advice I received about YouTube was to create a schedule of days to post so your viewers look forward to videos. That just doesn’t work for me. Whenever I became too busy with work, I couldn’t stick to my typical Tuesday or Thursday schedule. I think it’s best to focus on how many times you can post in a week rather than a specific day. I try to post at least once a week and that’s my goal. You can always increase as your workload gets lighter or you when you are able to do YouTube full-time.</p><h2 id="2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner"><a href="#2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner"></a>2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner</h2><p>A notebook planner is essential for keeping my life organized and on track. When I first started my channel, I had a separate planner just for my YouTube videos – this didn’t work cause I never looked at it. It worked best when I kept track of my entire life, including YouTube, in one planner since I look at it every day. Then I could also see which days I wanted to post a video or see what topics worked best around specific holidays and such.</p><h2 id="3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance"><a href="#3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the weather forecast in advance"></a>3. Check the weather forecast in advance</h2><p>When starting a YouTube channel, many YouTubers like myself don’t have the money to afford all the fancy lighting you see other creators using. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >I use natural light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means I have to make sure it’s going to be a sunny day or at least bright enough for my videos to be clear. I check the forecast for the week on Sunday evenings so I can plan out my best days to film, this keeps my video shooting schedule productive.</p><h2 id="4-Create-3-5-videos-in-advance"><a href="#4-Create-3-5-videos-in-advance" class="headerlink" title="4. Create 3-5 videos in advance"></a>4. Create 3-5 videos in advance</h2><p>This week I am on PTO (paid time off) which has given me a lot more time to film videos I can post for next month. Life happens and it can set you back on filming. If you happen to get a major break in your workweek, use the opportunity to film a bunch of videos, edit them, and have them waiting in your pocket. I filmed three videos in one day – I planned and set-up the night before, which made filming much smoother. Trust me, this tip works wonders!</p><h2 id="5-Be-creative-Create-audios-audio-only-videos"><a href="#5-Be-creative-Create-audios-audio-only-videos" class="headerlink" title="5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)"></a>5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)</h2><p>In the event that life gets too crazy, it’s perfectly fine to do just audio. Many of us are always on the go which means it’s the perfect time to listen to great advice while driving to work, waiting on the bus, or working at the gym. Someone out there would love to hear your advice. I started to do this with my Tea Time Talk Audios and the response was great.</p><p>I hope these tips can help you on your journey with YouTube while still working a full-time job.</p><h2 id="Make-a-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Make-a-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Make a YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Make a YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is one application that people prefer over any other video editing application due to its easy-to-use editing tools and social media aimed settings.

Two of the major differences between them are:</p><p>Annotations are not clickable on mobile devices.</p><p>You cannot choose the size or positioning of Cards.</p><p>This article will teach you about both Cards and Annotations and discuss the best uses for each of them.</p><p><strong>Part 1: Annotations</strong></p><p>Annotations are messages that float overtop of your videos in the YouTube player. Usually, annotations are clickable and take users to other content created by you.</p><p><strong>Section 1: Types of Annotations</strong></p><p>There are five types of YouTube annotations:</p><p><strong>Notes</strong> are colored boxes placed over the top of your videos.</p><p><strong>Speech Bubbles</strong> look like dialogue boxes in a comic strip. They have tails that you can adjust so it looks like one of the people in your video is saying what is written in the annotation.</p><p><strong>Spotlights</strong> have a subtle border and are completely clear inside. Your text only appears when a viewer’s cursor hovers over top of these annotations.</p><p><strong>Labels</strong> are like spotlights except that viewers do not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.</p><p>Any of these annotations can be used to link viewers to other videos, or as subscribe links. You can also add a simple <strong>Title</strong> to your video through the Annotations menu.</p><p><strong>Section 2: How to Use Annotations</strong></p><p>*Note: the above video mentions Pause annotations, which are no longer available.</p><p>Here are two of the best uses for annotations:</p><p><strong>Clickable End Cards &#x2F; Outros</strong></p><p>One of the best ways you can use spotlight annotations is to create clickable end cards for your videos.</p><p>When your video finishes playing the YouTube player will display a selection of suggested videos that might direct viewers away from your channel. You can keep more of these viewers watching your content by creating your own ‘suggested videos’ card and putting it at the end of your videos.</p><p>Put thumbnails of two or three of your other videos on your end card, or use ‘picture-in-picture’ to actually imbed footage from them. Then, after you upload your video, go in and place clickable spotlight annotations over top of your video thumbnails.</p><p>This is one use for annotations that cannot be duplicated with cards.</p><p><strong>Promoting Your Videos</strong></p><p>You should not wait until the end of your video to start linking viewers to other content. Many viewers will click away before they see your end card because your video is not exactly what they were looking for. By placing note or speech bubble annotations occasionally throughout your videos you can catch some of these people before they click off of your channel.</p><p>This works especially well if you link to videos on similar subjects to the one you are annotating.</p><p>Instead of just linking to another video of yours, try to link to that video on a playlist. Once a viewer is on a playlist your videos will auto-play after each other, which is good for both your view count and watch time.</p><p>You can also use the newer YouTube Cards for this, but Annotations might still be a better choice because viewers only need to click once vs. twice for Cards.</p><p>Try both and see which performs best for your channel. It might be in your best interest to keep on using both as they target different audiences – Cards are clickable on mobile devices, for example, but Annotations are not.</p><h4 id="Part-2-YouTube-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Cards"></a><strong>Part 2: YouTube Cards</strong></h4><p>YouTube Cards are newer than annotations and a lot of people believe they will one day replace Annotations. While there are benefits to Cards – like embedding images to represent your links – you cannot choose the shape, size, or placement of them. This means they have limited uses.</p><p>When viewers click on a Card they are shown additional information and a thumbnail representing the page they will be taken to if they choose to click again. This extra step could be either help viewers decide to click your links or give them a second chance to decide they would rather not.</p><p><strong>Section 1: When to Use Cards</strong></p><p>A linked Annotation is simply a call to action viewers can click on. A Card is a call to action as well, but instead of taking the viewer directly to where its link leads when it is clicked a Card opens up into a larger version of itself with a thumbnail image.</p><p>Crowdfunding pages (Patreon is a great choice for video creators), charity fundraising pages, and merchandise stores are all examples of links that benefit from the format of YouTube Cards.</p><p>When you link a viewer to a non-YouTube page you break up their session time, which negatively impacts your watch time and SEO ranking. You want to make sure that the viewers you are directing away from YouTube are the ones most likely to convert after they leave. By ‘convert’ we mean to contribute to your Patreon campaign, donate to the charity you are promoting, or buy some of your merchandise.</p><p>Giving viewers more information and a thumbnail through a Card can help ensure the most interested viewers are the ones clicking your links.</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less

Against all odds, the average investor made a profit, and some of the most important stocks raised to new highs, and 2022 might bring even more profits for those who are patient and make their due diligence.</p><p>There is a lot of information online and in books about the stock market and how to make intelligent investments, but Youtube channels seem to be where most investors get their information from. This might be due to how easily information is passed to the listener.</p><p>In this article, we will talk about the best Youtube channels for the stock market. We will list the top fourteen channels that will definitely help you make the most out of your investment, whether you are looking for short or long-term investments.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">14 Best Stock Youtube Channels</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">FAQs about Stock Youtube Channels</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-14-Best-Stock-Youtube-Channels"><a href="#Part-1-14-Best-Stock-Youtube-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 14 Best Stock Youtube Channels"></a>Part 1: 14 Best Stock Youtube Channels</h2><h3 id="1-Sasha-Evdakov-Tradersfly"><a href="#1-Sasha-Evdakov-Tradersfly" class="headerlink" title="1.Sasha Evdakov: Tradersfly"></a>1.Sasha Evdakov: Tradersfly</h3><p>This is one of the best Youtube channels for stock market beginners. Sasha Evdakov is a great teacher and can introduce the hardest topics to everyone, regarding their level of knowledge in the stock market.</p><p>By going through his first videos, you’ll get a general idea of the basics of how to approach the stock market in 2022. He advocates more long-term investments and because he’s located in the United States, most of the information about stocks is about U.S. stocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the largest companies in the world trade in the U.S. stock market. He’s very reciprocal and willing to share new ideas with his members. Definitely a good start if you want to dig more into stocks. He started his channel back in 2021 and releases videos once a week.</p><h3 id="2-Investors-Underground"><a href="#2-Investors-Underground" class="headerlink" title="2. Investors Underground"></a>2. Investors Underground</h3><p>Investors Underground is a 145K subscriber stock market channel based in the U.S. A great plus of this channel is its live chat and great instructional videos. It was created by two investors back in May of 2013. Besides having a strong following, in this channel, you can also connect with other traders and exchange information and tips on what stocks might be good to hold for the long term or others that might be better to sell. In this channel, you can also have daily recaps so you can be on top of all the major movements during the day and not miss anything. Investors Underground has many lessons from beginners to more advanced traders so it is recommended for all types of investors. You can also follow them on other social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram to have constant updates throughout your day.</p><h3 id="3-Young-And-Investing"><a href="#3-Young-And-Investing" class="headerlink" title="3. Young And Investing"></a>3. Young And Investing</h3><p>This channel releases two videos every quarter, which means these are usually longer and encompass more information than the channels that release videos every week. But in general, these have more accurate information because the creators have more time to analyze all the data.

You can, therefore, integrate Google’s products with YouTube easily.</p><p>Step 1. First, go to the slide where you want to embed your video.</p><p>Step 2. Then choose the “Insert” option from the menu bar and hit the “Video” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-2.png"                      alt="how to add youtube video to google slides"                ></p><p>Step 3.

Format your video. Remember that the entire video will be embedded. You don’t necessarily need the whole video. It is time to select just a brief but relevant clip from the video to use. Then position your video to the right point using the axes from the exact starting point to the finished part you want the video to appear in.</p><h4 id="Method-2-Embed-YouTube-video-to-Google-Slide-by-direct-link"><a href="#Method-2-Embed-YouTube-video-to-Google-Slide-by-direct-link" class="headerlink" title="Method 2.

If your YouTube videos get flagged for copyright issues relating to the background music or film clips it can be frustrating, especially if you receive a copyright notice for using royalty-free music you have a license for. Rather than feeling as though your creativity is being restrained, read this article to better understand the reasons copyright issues come up and what can be done to resolve them. Disputing copyright claims is something that any YouTuber can do.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1：-What-is-a-Content-ID-Claim-and-Why-Have-I-Received-One"><a href="#Part-1：-What-is-a-Content-ID-Claim-and-Why-Have-I-Received-One" class="headerlink" title="Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?"></a>Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?</h2><p>YouTube copyright issues often come up as a result of content ID claims. This will prompt Google support to deliver a copyright notice to your account. Content ID claims are generally made against content that contains material that should not be available on YouTube. Claims are often issued if you don’t own the music, movie clips, TV clips, express rights to showcase cut scenes in video games, or other copyrighted media.</p><p>If you happen to see that a video has been muted or taken down you can visit the copyright notices section of your video manager to learn more. In this section you will learn more about what will be done as a result of the content ID claim.</p><p>Generally, a content ID claim does not put a YouTube channel in any kind of trouble. What usually happens is that the video is removed, you lose the ability to earn ad revenue from it, or the sound is muted so the copyrighted music no longer plays.</p><p>In some cases, the owner of the copyrighted content (usually musical artists) may choose to allow you to keep your video up in exchange for running their ads.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Dealing-With-a-Copyright-Claim-on-Your-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Dealing-With-a-Copyright-Claim-on-Your-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video</h2><p>If you have received copyright claims there are ways that you can get your content put back up in its original condition.</p><p>First, you could purchase the rights to use the copyrighted media after your video has been flagged or try getting express permission from the content creator to use aspects of their content in your own original video.</p><p>Sometimes, your videos may be flagged even though you’ve already purchased the license for the copyrighted music, images or clips you are using.</p><p>YouTube’s robots automatically scan through the database of audio and visual content that is put up by copyright owners. Any video that has been uploaded to YouTube with this copyrighted content will receive a third-party copyright notice. Because flagging happens automatically it often affects creators who have licenses for the royalty-free music, or other copyrighted material, they are using.</p><p>The good news is that this same level of protection will ensure that your own original content can also be protected from reuse if you register it.</p><p>In order to dispute a copyright claim on your video the first thing that you will need is some proof that you have purchased the rights to the music or other content that is being reused in your video. If you have a direct link to the online license agreement this can help with the dispute process. Purchasing a license online for royalty-free music or other content is usually fairly simple and with a PDF license certificate you can quickly dispute copyright content ID claims.</p><p>You can upload your license document to the file sharing system Dropbox to make the content public for YouTube admins to check over. Heading over to your video manager on YouTube and sending a message link with the dispute and link to your license will make sure that your explanation is heard. Sending the license, written permission, or a link to the legal license will result in YouTube reinstating your video.</p><p>Most of the time the only information that you need to use is where the license was purchased as well as the link to where the copyright license document can be accessed.</p><p>After submitting your dispute YouTube admins will often take a few business days to get back to you with an answer. There is no risk involved in disputing a copyright claim; your video has already been flagged. In the worst case scenario, your video will remain flagged.</p><p>Usually with the help of an official license or direct permission from the content creator you can file a dispute with YouTube and receive an answer. If the dispute process is successful your video will be reinstated to the original uploaded version without blocked sound or content.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://giphy.com/gifs/ooc-loki-gif-hooray-jivfl42uReUz6" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-viral-video-marketing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering the Art of Viral Video Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-master-subtitles-from-srt-with-3-steps/"><u>In 2024, Master Subtitles From SRT with 3 Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-infographics-boosting-buzz-through-social-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Infographics  Boosting Buzz Through Social Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-make-sense-of-iphone-video-repetition-tech/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Make Sense of iPhone Video Repetition Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-integrating-youtube-into-tv-sets-with-loop-features/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Integrating YouTube Into TV Sets with Loop Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/set-your-preferred-job-location-on-linkedin-app-of-your-oneplus-ace-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Set Your Preferred Job Location on LinkedIn App of your OnePlus Ace 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-harmonize-your-youtube-presence-with-these-ideal-microphones-for-various-channels/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Harmonize Your YouTube Presence With These Ideal Microphones for Various Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-quick-fix-for-disabled-photo-viewer-back-on-win-11-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Quick Fix for Disabled Photo Viewer Back on Win 11 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-how-to-add-edit-and-optimize-youtube-tagstitledescription-for-more-views/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Add, Edit and Optimize YouTube Tags/Title/Description for More Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-navigating-through-youtubes-top-favorite-shorters/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating Through YouTube’s Top Favorite Shorters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-navigating-to-the-best-10-affordable-online-channels-for-graphic-design/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating to the Best 10 Affordable Online Channels for Graphic Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-movie-substitutes-that-shook-up-my-world-7-choices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Movie Substitutes That Shook Up My World -
