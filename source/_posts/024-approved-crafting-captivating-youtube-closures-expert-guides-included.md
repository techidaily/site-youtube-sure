In this guide, I’ll demystify what YouTube outro is and how to make outro and add it to a YouTube video. If you are not a tech expert, use intro and outro makers highlighted herein to make your videos as interactive pas possible.

To get a sneak preview of what is entailed here; this guide has been subdivided into five parts:

* [Part 3: How To Make And Add Outro To YouTube Video](#part3)
* [Part 4: How To Add An Outro To A Youtube Video](#part4)
* [Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Outro](#part5)

## Part 1: YouTube Outro Prerequisites

In this part, we will learn what outros for YouTube are, the importance of land that distinguishes them from the intro. Also included are expert tips on how to make YouTube outro that attracts a hundred thousand subscribers in seven days included.

To understand what YouTube outro is and why you should add it to your videos, here is a detailed explanation.

![youtube outro making guide](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-outro-guide.jpg)

## Section 1: What is a Youtube Outro?

YouTube outro aka end screen is the last part of a video with a call to action statement, button or video suggestion to view other YouTube videos. In other words, it’s the last part of a video with calls to action links.

One of the most effective technical methods of optimizing YouTube videos is by adding an outro. This helps attract huge traffic, increase conversion and engage viewers.

Why spend your time adding outro? You can add Outro to YouTube videos to direct viewers to your website, other selected videos, engage viewers for longer and to persuade them to subscribe to the channel. In short, most end screens have four elements incorporated into an outro: Channel, subscribe, Video playlist and a website link.

## Section 2: Difference Between Outro and Intro

Most YouTube videos have an intro and an outro. In this case, an intro is a short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces you to the viewers and your brand.

Even though video creators attach more emphasis on intros, both are both very critical. For your videos to achieve meaningful results, it’s important to view each as distinct from the other. Equally important to know, both intros and outros have different purposes.

| Differences Between YouTube Intro And Outro                     |                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Intro                                                           | Outro                                 |
| Inserted at the begging of a video                              | Inserted at the end of a video        |
| Used to capture audience attention                              | Directs the audience to the next step |
| Introduces the topic                                            | Suggests new topics to viewers        |
| Attract viewers to the video                                    | Contains a call-action button         |
| Showcases a brand, logo, business slogan or a statement mission |                                       |

## Section 3: YouTube Outro Requirements

Just as their requirements for any video uploaded on YouTube, outros are no exception. For your outro to be interactive, observe the following requirements:

**1\. Outro Resolution**

Outros for YouTube should have an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a resolution of 1920px X 1080px.

**2\. Outro Element Sizes and Dimensions**

End screen templates comprise elements that are in different shapes and sizes. When using a YouTube outro size of 1920px X 1080px, here are the element dimensions to use:

* Subscribe – 294px X 294px
* Channel – 294px X 294px
* Website link - 294px X 294px
* Video playlist – 615px X 345px

![youtube outro screen format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-outro-dimensions.jpg)

**3\. Outro Length**

If you want to make your outro boring, make it long. So, how long should YouTube outro be? For your outros to have a high conversation rate, they should be approximately 10-20 seconds long. However, the length of your video should be the determining factor. A one-hour YouTube video can have a longer outro.

Don’t be challenged by setting the above sizes because nearly all intro and outro makers have already set dimensions for the elements. The major requirements are done for you

## Section 4: Best Practices When Making A YouTube Outro

Imagine given 10 seconds to showcase your YouTube channel and direct viewers on the next move without breaking the engagement! Different YouTube outros come in different styles; certainly a show of one's degree of creativity.

At this point, you should be already be having the best outro maker in mind - [**Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The below YouTube outro tips should coincide with the features of your selected outro maker.

![tips to make outro for YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-outro-tips.jpg)

1. **Be relevant**

The featured elements should be related to the video. Adding irrelevant elements your outro will most likely make the viewer click away.

1. **Keep to your goals**

The big question is; what do you want to achieve from the YouTube end screen? Draw your attention to the subject matter of that particular video, your channel or the product highlighted in the video. Try to align your thoughts with those of the viewer.

Every video creator wishes for the following goals, increasing your channel subscribers, sending traffic to another site, viewing more videos and sharing to social media. Each YouTube outro element should have its own goal.

1. **Simple, clear and easy to interpret**

Your outro will be meaningless if the audience cannot take action due to the complexity of either the language used or the ambiguity of words used. Use colors that pop out the elements making them the center of focus. Make them clear and avoid anything distractive.

1. **Use similar outro templates**

Apart from being a good method of branding your channel, using similar outro on your videos adds credibility. It is, therefore, a good practice to have the consistency of colors, elements, images, and logos.

It’s absolutely important to understand all the prerequisites related to YouTube outros. Make use of the tips and requirements explained above when making and adding YouTube end screens to achieve the best results.
