## How to Edit Recorded YouTube Video

Regardless of the software, you are using to edit your YouTube videos, there are common steps that you can follow to make your journey a success. Filmora is efficient and reliable software that you can easily operate when editing your videos. This is why I will take you through the steps that you need to take when editing YouTube videos with this program.

**Step 1: Split or combine your video clips**

Just like other alternative editing programs, the Wondershare Filmora video editing program has a timeline view of the project you are working on. This is where you can cut or drop your shots as each of the shots are in separate files that you should combine with others to make one complete video.

![split video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg)

Filmora has an effective split feature, that can help you cut footage into parts, and after, you can move the splits into the correct position or delete the unwanted parts. The Quick Trim feature can help you to choose any part of your video quickly when previewing.

Filmora supports almost all the formats used to make videos and photos and this will help you reduce obstacles when you want to combine footage shot with different devices. With such capabilities, it is easy to add video clips, photos, and audio when editing Your YouTube Videos.

For you to combine several footages into one, you need to place all clips in the video track in an orderly way. Then set the timeline view and move the shots around, cut or trim to shorten as you prefer. To give your final production a professional look, you can add transitions between shots.

**Step 2: Rotate, Crop, Pan, and Zoom**

![pan and zoom video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/crop-video-filmora.jpg)

At this point, you can rotate the video at any angle, or direction and you can as well change the scale of your video footage. If you want the viewers to focus on a certain part of the video frame, apply the Pan & Zoom feature.

**Step 3: Add audio, texts, and more effects.**

Now that you have edited your different video shots into a single video, you can now take the step of adding some more effects to your video. At this point, you can add different staff such as music, texts, and different other effects that you would prefer your viewers to see in your video. Some may think this is difficult to do if they have not tried it before.

The Wondershare Filmora screen editor has appropriate features to help you add all the effect you need without wasting time at all. This program will guide you through how to add effects to your YouTube videos. This is an important step in answering the question asked by many; **is it illegal to record music from YouTube**? If you adhere to YouTube rules and policy, you can incorporate music and other effects into your YouTube videos without fear.

**Step 4: Save and Export**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

After adding all the special effects, you are almost at the final stage. The next important thing to do is to choose the format of saving your video file. After making sure that your video format is set, and then you can export your video file.

Remember to save your file in a format acceptable to the platform that you are intending to upload your videos. Some of the major video formats accepted by YouTube include MP4, AVI, and VMA. You can use any of these formats to save your YouTube video files.

You don’t need to upload your videos later as the Filmora features will allow you to upload YouTube videos directly. It will choose the appropriate format, frame, and codec that suit your video files.

When editing your YouTube videos on your computer, remember to follow the above steps carefully, and remember to use the right widescreen format, and render your video files in either 1080p or 720p high definition.

Having equipped yourself with such knowledge, you can download the Filmora software and install it on your computer as it is one of the very best software when it comes to recording and editing videos and audio.
