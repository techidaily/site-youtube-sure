    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Best-YouTube-Video-Marketing-Strategies"><a href="#5-Best-YouTube-Video-Marketing-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="5 Best YouTube Video Marketing Strategies"></a>5 Best YouTube Video Marketing Strategies</h2><p>YouTube is undoubtedly the most famous video sharing platform in the world. More than 5 billion videos are watched every single minute on YouTube. And the ever-growing user base has propelled YouTube to the status of 2nd most popular social media platform in the world, and the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >second most visited website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after Google in 2021.</p><p>YouTube marketing is great for both businesses and individuals who want to make careers out of YouTube. Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p><p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p><h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p><h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p><p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p><p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p><h3 id="c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts"><a href="#c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts" class="headerlink" title="c. Try Giveaways and gifts"></a>c. Try Giveaways and gifts</h3><p>You can boost the viewership and subscriber count for your channel by setting up occasional giveaways or gifts to the viewers. Make sure that you set the winning criteria to have the viewers subscribe to the channel.</p><p>For example, let’s take another popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p><p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p><p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers. However, from the announcement date that is June 27th to June 30th, 2018, the channel saw an increase of a whopping <a class="link"   href="https://www.trackalytics.com/youtube/user/unboxtherapy/" >52,173 subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>! Till date, the video has over 14 million views</p><p>We do not advise you to try this out when you are just starting your YouTube career. Only venture out to such investments when you are stable when it comes to earnings.</p><h2 id="Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback"><a href="#Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback"></a><strong>Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback</strong></h2><p>All your videos must be created with the audience in mind. However, sometimes what you may think would work might not fit well with the audience. Hence, it is imperative that you understand their likes and dislikes.</p><p>And the best way to improve your videos is to take suggestions from the audience themselves. You can ask them specific questions on how to improve your videos or what they want to see in your future creations. Take notes on what they have to offer and start building your content taking in those suggestions.</p><p>There is also another facet to incorporating audience feedback as it projects your YouTube channel to be responsive to the audience, something that is vital to building a strong and loyal viewer base on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources"><a href="#Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources" class="headerlink" title="Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources"></a><strong>Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources</strong></h2><p>YouTube has made it easier for you to track the sources from which your videos are getting the views. Sign in to YouTube Studio Beta and the click Reach from the Analytics menu provided on the left panel. Now click on Traffic source types.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Analytics"                ></p><p>In this window, you can see the different sources that led viewers to your video. Generally, it can be a mix of websites, YouTube recommendation’s, YouTube search, etc. Metrics like Watch Time gives you an idea of how long viewers watch your videos and Audience Retention shows how consistent they are at watching them. These are just two of the many metrics you can use to your advantage.</p><p>Analyzing YouTube videos will help you structure your future videos in a way that it is more susceptible to being clicked.</p><h2 id="Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos"><a href="#Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos"></a><strong>Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos</strong></h2><p>You must have an eye on the metrics that your videos garner over the days. While the number of views, likes, and dislikes are great indicators in determining the popularity of the videos, but there are many more factors at play.</p><p>Your video ranking is important as it determines the position of your videos when a keyword is typed into the search box. The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p><p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p><p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p><p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort. Having a rank tracker like the one from <a class="link"   href="https://seranking.com/position-tracking.html" >SE Ranking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/tools#keywordranktracking" >Tubebuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be quite handy at times like these.

So, if you are a new creator, think of what you can give to your audience instead of what you are getting. What is of value to your audience is more important as they’ll hang around your channel for passion.

Make the videos enticing such that when a user views one video, they end up clicking and viewing the next 5 or 10 of your other videos. Let it be enticing and corresponds to the topic of the moment.</p><h4 id="4-Add-a-good-channel-description"><a href="#4-Add-a-good-channel-description" class="headerlink" title="4) Add a good channel description"></a>4) Add a good channel description</h4><p>A viewer should know what your channel is all about just by a glance.

YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.</p><p>For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title"><a href="#2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="2.

Given how important it is, you’ll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.</p><h4 id="3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website"><a href="#3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website" class="headerlink" title="3.

Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description"><a href="#4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.</p><p>When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.</p><h4 id="5-Edit-The-Filename"><a href="#5-Edit-The-Filename" class="headerlink" title="5.

Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.</p><h4 id="7-Select-Video-Category"><a href="#7-Select-Video-Category" class="headerlink" title="7.

You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.</p><p>Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.</p><p>Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.</p><h4 id="9-Make-High-Quality-Longer"><a href="#9-Make-High-Quality-Longer" class="headerlink" title="9. Make High-Quality Longer"></a>9. Make High-Quality Longer</h4><p>Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content.

From there, click into the Analytics tab in the menu on the left of your screen.</p><p>In order to check which of your videos are performing the best, click on <strong>Watch time</strong> under <strong>Watch time reports</strong>. At the top of the page there’ll be a graph of your watch time in general, and if you scroll down you’ll see a list of your videos ranked by watch time. The best performing ones will be at the top and, to see more stats related to these high-performing videos, simply click on their titles. Afterwards, you’ll be able to click around the different sections in your Analytics and see reports relating to the specific video you clicked on.</p><p>The two main types of analytics reports are Watch Time Reports and Interaction Reports.</p><h3 id="1-Interpreting-YouTube-Watch-Time-Reports"><a href="#1-Interpreting-YouTube-Watch-Time-Reports" class="headerlink" title="1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports"></a>1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports</h3><p>To find <strong>Watch time reports</strong> you just need to log into your Google account, go to the <strong>Creator studio</strong>, click the analytics tab, and then click on <strong>watch time</strong>. You can see the watch time of every video on your channel, which is important data to have because watch time is the most important factor when it comes to ranking your video in search results.</p><p>A watch time report includes the total amount of time that your video, or a selection of videos, is actually being watched for. In order to make sure that you are publishing only quality videos you need to make sure that your viewers are consistently sticking to your videos and watching them all away through, or at least to the half-way mark. Watch time represents one of the most meaningful metrics in ensuring that you are engaging your audience.</p><p>YouTube analytics can now display a watch time of every video that you have produced. Seeing the metrics on how long people are actually watching every video that you produce can show you what you’ve done right in the past and what you need to do more of to continue raising your watch time.</p><p>Alongside watch time you can see the average duration individual viewers are watching your videos for. The average percentage of your video that gets viewed will showcase areas where you may be struggling with your video content. For example, if an abnormally high number of viewers are clicking away during your intro, there’s probably something about that clip that needs to be changed.</p><p>In the watch time reports for individual videos, you will be able to see data on where your views are coming from and which demographics are watching the most. Where your viewers are watching, in terms of desktop or mobile, is also interesting data that is available in this section.</p><p>Click here for more tips on<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/12-proven-ways-to-increase-youtube-views-315.html" >increasing your views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports"><a href="#2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports" class="headerlink" title="2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports"></a>2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports</h3><p>Interaction reports are related to the actions viewers take – i.e. subscribing to your channel, liking your videos, or leaving a comments. You can find interaction reports in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics</strong>.</p><p>Interaction reports can be broken down into several different reports that can help determine the overall performance of any YouTube videos. The main interaction reports that you should be interested in include:</p><p><strong>1. Subscribers:</strong> You can find extensive data on your subscribers, like demographics including age groups and gender. Learning more about your subscribers can help you to tailor your content. For example, if you learn that your viewers are mostly young women under 24 in the USA, you can do research into what is currently popular with young women under 24 in the USA.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to see your subscriber count in real-time? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>2. Likes and dislikes:</strong> Likes and dislikes aren’t a powerful metric when it comes to search engine rankings, but they provide useful information to creators. If you’re getting a lot of dislikes on a video, you should look into why. If you’re getting a lot of likes on a video, it can indicate that you should focus on creating similar content.</p><p><strong>3. Playlists:</strong> A viewer watching a video in a playlist is much more likely to keep watching more videos from that playlist, making playlists great for the growth of your channel. Reports in this section will help you figure out which of your playlists is performing best, which could give you an idea of which types of videos or video topics are going over best with your viewers.</p><p><strong>4. Comments:</strong> Reading comments is a great way to figure out what your viewers think, but that’s not all they’re good for. If viewers return to a video to continue talking to you or other viewers then that will drive up your views and watch time. If a video is especially good at generating discussion, you should figure out why (i.e. your sign-off question) and keep doing it.</p><p><strong>5. Sharing:</strong> Discovering where your video is being shared can be important for figuring out what platforms you should be on besides YouTube. If your video is shared and viewed a lot on Twitter, you should consider making a Twitter account for your channel.</p><p><strong>6. Cards:</strong> Tracking the performance of your Cards will help you optimize them to direct traffic between your videos. By testing out different time stamps for cards you’ll find the perfect places to put them. By trying different messages in your cards you’ll learn how to write ‘calls to action’ that mobilize your viewers.</p><p><strong>End screens:</strong> End Screens are essential for keeping viewers on your channel. The report of the click-through rates of your end screens is important for helping you figure out which kinds of links work, and which style of ends screen is most effective for you. Are people more likely to click when you talk to them through the end screen, or when it’s a static card?</p><p><strong>7. 360 heat map reports:</strong> A heat map report works specifically with 360° videos if you are choosing to engage your audience with this type of content. Viewing YouTube video statistics for 360° heat maps will help to show the areas on your video that viewers are most interested in.</p><h2 id="How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics"><a href="#How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics" class="headerlink" title="How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics"></a>How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics</h2><p>If you want to check out the statistics of rival YouTube channels (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-subscriber-chart---the-5-most-subscribed-youtube-channels-320.html" >including the most subscribed channels on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), or channels you’re a fan of, try using <a class="link"   href="http://www.socialblade.com/" >Social Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

You’ll be able to see reports on daily views, channel growth, and even estimated ad revenue (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-view-calculators---calculate-youtube-money%21-322.html" >learn more about how to view a channel’s ad revenue here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p>Now that you know how to view YouTube statistics, what will you do with them?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ew-age-monetization-cost-effective-channel-options-for-2024/"><u>[New] New Age Monetization  Cost-Effective Channel Options for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-top-free-youtube-rippers-reviewed/"><u>In 2024, Top Free YouTube Rippers Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-score-your-youtube-content-with-these-free-sounds/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Score Your YouTube Content With These Free Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-cutting-edge-tools-youtubes-finest-editors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Cutting Edge Tools  YouTube's Finest Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-top-listings-of-youtube-partner-opportunities-and-advertisements/"><u>In 2024, Top Listings of YouTube Partner Opportunities and Advertisements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-complete-2023-youtubers-handbook-for-rotated-content/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Complete 2023 Youtuber's Handbook for Rotated Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/s-best-free-video-editing-programs-of-2023-for-2024/"><u>10+ Best Free Video Editing Programs of 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-optimal-recorders-top-10-tools-for-webinars/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Optimal Recorders  Top 10 Tools for Webinars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-yogic-alchemy-transform-your-body-mind-and-spirit/"><u>In 2024, Yogic Alchemy - Transform Your Body, Mind & Spirit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-uncovering-illegal-gain-from-false-subscriber-sales/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Uncovering Illegal Gain From False Subscriber Sales</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-expert-picked-screen-capturers-of-movies-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Expert-Picked Screen Capturers of Movies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-switch-saving-gameplay-footage/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Switch  Saving Gameplay Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-assortment-of-video-capturing-technology/"><u>[Updated] Assortment of Video Capturing Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-country-on-app-store-for-iphone-xs-max-with-7-methods-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Change Country on App Store for iPhone XS Max With 7 Methods | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/enhancing-photos-allure-expert-color-correction-steps/"><u>Enhancing Photos' Allure  Expert Color Correction Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-motorola-moto-g-stylus-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)?

Getting people to watch them is the next and a much bigger obstacle in your path. Just as a blogger must work hard to get people to read their blog, so a YouTuber needs to find ways to get more views on their videos.</p><p>For any piece of content on the internet, discoverability is key to exposure. After all, nobody will watch your video or read your blog if they can’t find it, right? A blogger would do this by lacing their content with SEO - search engine optimization. But how can a YouTuber do the same? The answer lies in something known as YouTube tags optimization. In this article, we will let you know how to <strong>add, edit and optimize YouTube tags</strong> easily for more views, and some tips on <strong>YouTube title and description</strong>.</p><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">What are YouTube tags and why they are so important</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to come up with YouTube tags and optimize them</a></li><li><a href="#part3">How to Tag YouTube and Add Title, Description</a></li><li><a href="#part4">How to Improve YouTube video Metadata: Tags, Title, Description</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description</a></li></ul><hr><p>Before we get started, I want to recommend the best video editing software for YouTubers - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an easy to use while powerful video editor that allows you not only to cut, split, crop, resize, reverse your videos, but also offers you multiple video effects specially designed for Fashion, Beauty, Gaming, Travel, Education, etc. Check the video to know more fantastic features:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-YouTube-tags-and-why-they-are-so-important"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-YouTube-tags-and-why-they-are-so-important" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are YouTube tags and why they are so important"></a>Part 1: What are YouTube tags and why they are so important</h2><p>YouTube tags are used when you upload a video on YouTube. You need to specify the type of video. In other words, you need to describe your video with keywords. But you might think about why you need to add these words. YouTube can’t figure out what my videos are about? Unfortunately, YouTube can’t though its algorithm is much more advanced than before.</p><p>You must know the competition between videos is furious since <a class="link"   href="https://tubularinsights.com/hours-minute-uploaded-youtube/" >500 hours of video per minute are uploaded on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this case, it is important to let the YouTube algorithm know your video by adding related tags to have a higher ranking. So the better tags we choose, the higher chance to rank in the top 1, which means you will get more views!</p><p>Using YouTube meta tags wisely can broaden your reach and help new people discover your content. However, don’t be tempted to insert irrelevant tags just because you know they are high traffic. You will be found out and penalized as a result. Just as you did with your description, research your keywords, place the most important ones first and use as many as you can.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types"><a href="#What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types" class="headerlink" title="What are the three YouTube tag types?"></a>What are the three YouTube tag types?</h3><p>YouTube has three different types of tags and each of them has a specific purpose. The tags are-</p><p><strong>Specific</strong> – The specific tag types are keywords-oriented. These keywords specifically pertain to the content of your video. In this tag type, the particular video is highlighted with the keyword tags. Often while typing the keywords in your mind, YouTube suggests phrases and keywords according to the content of your video. You may apply the suggestions and also add more general or common versions of the same keywords.</p><p><strong>Compound</strong> – The compound tags are usually using more than two words. Many a time it is seen that users prefer tagging the complete title of the video. If you are using your video title as the compound tag, ensure that you do not include the prepositions like or, as, and, etc. This is because YouTube allows just 500 characters in the title and ignore the prepositions. It is always advised to use all the 500 characters YouTube has allowed without wasting the characters on prepositions as it will automatically be ignored.</p><p><strong>Generic</strong> – The generic tags are the ones that describe the entire video in one or two words. These tags are used in all the videos of yours. These tags are used across your channel for all the videos you post. It is important to have such general constant tags.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them"></a>Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them</h2><p>The more relevant tags you add, the better it is. The best part is YouTube doesn’t restrict the number of tags but adding all is not possible and adding something irrelevant doesn’t make sense. So, your YouTube video tags must be the smart ones for more views. Educated tagging is what is required.</p><p>1. <strong>Brand-Specific Tags Addition</strong> - Every business wants their brand name to show up in the search results on YouTube and Google. Self-referencing your video or tagging your brand name in a number of variations is a smart way of letting others know your brand.</p><p>2. <strong>Using YouTube Auto Suggest</strong> – Play with the search option on YouTube and check out the YouTube suggestions when you search. Try to recognize the common videos that pop up while searching for something important and relevant to yours. Try searching for random keywords according to your YouTube search experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-suggest.jpg"                      alt="youtube auto suggest"                ></p><p>3. <strong>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/" >YouTube Keyword Search Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – Lastly, you may use the YouTube keyword suggestion tool. It helps you to extract the relevant keywords from the videos of your competitors and create suggestions according to the basic term provided by you.</p><p>4. <strong>Use Specific Tags</strong> - After using tools, you need to narrow down your tags specifically, like tags “learn 3D paper cutting”. The search volume may not be huge, but these kinds of tags can let YouTube know your video very well. Give it a try!</p><p>5. <strong>Check competitor’s Tags</strong> - When you check tags from other brands, it is not suggested to copy them all. What you need to do is find what you are missing and try to cover that area. However, only third-party tools can help you do that. In the market, <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is highly used. It has a free version. Most of all data including tags can be found for higher views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/vidiq-tags.jpg"                      alt="youtube tags for views"                ></p><p><strong>YouTube Tags Bonus Tips</strong></p><p>Here you can learn some tips when optimizing tags. You can use singular and plural tags. Sometimes remember to add some misspelling tags because users tend to mistype some words, so it’s better to cover this kind of tag. You can <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly%5Fmisspelled%5FEnglish%5Fwords" >get more information on misspelled words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. More tips are listed below.</p><ul><li>Build on what you learned in your keyword research and use high traffic keywords as tags</li><li>Use as many tags as possible, but without being spammy</li><li>Build related playlists using particular tags</li><li>Be generic; ‘big’, ‘funny’ and ‘sweet’ are fine, but ‘luscious’, ‘delightful’ and ‘splendid’ don’t make the best tags</li><li>Put the most important tags first</li><li>Mix single word tags with ‘long tail’ tags, e.g. ‘how to’</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Tag-YouTube-and-Add-Title-Description"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Tag-YouTube-and-Add-Title-Description" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Tag YouTube and Add Title, Description"></a>Part 3: How to Tag YouTube and Add Title, Description</h2><h3 id="For-a-New-Video"><a href="#For-a-New-Video" class="headerlink" title="For a New Video"></a>For a New Video</h3><ul><li>Step 1.

It helps people search for your video, helps YouTube to categorize it correctly and, when done well, can broaden the reach of your content. YouTube meta consists of three main parts: tags, title and description. Here’s how you can use each of these three elements to create powerful metadata for your video:</p><h3 id="1-Title"><a href="#1-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Title"></a>1. Title</h3><p>YouTube titles play a big part in the ranking factors for search. That means you’ve got to think about what the people most likely to want to see your video will type into the search bar, as well as the words that accurately describe your video.</p><p>For example, if you have a clip of your cat Fluffy climbing a tree, calling your video ‘Fluffy climbs a tree’ is not the best idea. Nobody knows who Fluffy is; it could be your rabbit, dog, daughter or feather duster for all the YouTube community knows, and nobody is going to be searching for it.</p><p>A better title would be ‘cat climbs a tree, but you could even improve on that. How about ‘funny cat climbs a tree’, which would capture all those people looking for funny cat videos. Or, even better, ‘funny Persian cat climbs a tree’, also capturing those people who adore Persian cats.</p><p>You can see how building awesome YouTube titles can happen organically like this, but it’s also worth doing your homework too. We have collected a handful of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to improve your YouTube meta, so check out the suggestions and work forwards from there.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Research your keywords and include high traffic keywords at the start of the title</li><li>Keep titles under 70 characters</li><li>Branding, episode number, and other non-essential info should be at the end of the title</li><li>Review your YouTube titles from time to time and update with new keywords as search trends change</li><li>Avoid clickbait titles or misleading titles as this will affect your view time and subsequently your ranking in search</li></ul><h3 id="2-Description"><a href="#2-Description" class="headerlink" title="2. Description"></a>2. Description</h3><p>Your description is a much longer piece of YouTube meta, so you can really go to town with your YouTube keywords here. You’ve got up to 5,000 characters to fill in, and we strongly advise that you aim to use every single one. This really is a golden opportunity, not only to get people motivated to watch all of your video, but also to be indexed correctly through well researched YouTube keywords.</p><p>You may have noticed that, on the search page itself, only a small part of the description actually shows up; 120 characters of it to be precise. This doesn’t affect indexing, but it does mean you have to plan your YouTube description carefully to really hook people into clicking through from just the first sentence or two.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Make the first sentence or two compelling and captivating to get people to click</li><li>Research the best YouTube keywords to use to ensure your video is correctly indexed</li><li>At the end of your YouTube description, include a call to action to direct viewers on what to do next (subscribe, click through to the website, look at a product, watch more videos, etc.)</li><li>If your video is long, consider placing time codes in your description to help users jump to their areas of interest</li><li>Add links to products showcased, your social channels, or website as you wish</li><li>Don’t forget to credit any music you’ve used here</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description"></a>Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description</h2><p>So, now we’ve got the basics down, let’s move on to some top tips for getting your metadata just right:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Do not spam</strong></li></ul><p>Irrelevant keywords will not do you any favors in the long run. Using a popular search term such as ‘funny cat’ when actually it’s a video of you unboxing your product will simply irritate your viewers. You’ll get more views, but for shorter durations, and that will hurt not only your ranking but also your reputation. The people you want to draw in with your YouTube meta should be those who are genuinely interested in your videos, as these are the people who will share, comment and interact with you.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Don’t put tags in the description</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube has given you a place to put your tags, and that’s not in the description area of your meta. Placing tags in the description area is known as tag stuffing and can lead to videos being removed or penalized.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Update regularly</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube meta is not a static thing. Trends change, search statistics fluctuate, and the needs of your viewers alter as time goes on.

With such a large community of music listeners on YouTube, many well-known and lesser-known musicians continue to upload their songs regularly. If you’re a music producer, you’ll probably want to do this as well. However, understanding how to upload music to YouTube might be difficult, so this article is created to assist you.</p><p>When you upload a song to YouTube, it becomes available to the entire globe. Unlike other streaming services, anyone can use YouTube for free. This is a one-of-a-kind platform for sharing music. This is an opportunity that every artist should take advantage of, with a potential audience of billions.</p><p>So, how do you go about uploading songs to YouTube? Regular file formats aren’t applicable; therefore, this is the only challenging component. YouTube does not recognize.mp3 or.mp4 files, which makes things a little more difficult for the average producer. It’s simple to get around this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-music-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="how to upload music to youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Details On Youtube Music</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</a></p><h2 id="Details-On-Youtube-Music"><a href="#Details-On-Youtube-Music" class="headerlink" title="Details On Youtube Music"></a>Details On Youtube Music</h2><p>YouTube recently added ‘YouTube Music’ to assist advertise the website as a music-focused destination. You don’t have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don’t want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube’s music.</p><p>Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.</p><p>Even though this is critical for compensating artists, it already restricts the audience’s reach. Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don’t have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn’t have any of these problems.</p><p>YouTube’s other services are also free, making them accessible to everybody regardless of their financial position. This implies that you can access the site as long as you have a phone or a laptop. Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site’s potential for musical promotion.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?"></a>Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</h2><p>YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.</p><h4 id="Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit"><a href="#Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit"></a>Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit</h4><p>The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube’s blog and Google’s 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it’s a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube’s new 2 GB size restriction.</p><h4 id="What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube"><a href="#What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?"></a>What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?</h4><ul><li>YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.</li><li>Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.</li><li>Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to. It also allows for the creation of a unique ambiance with a more or less subtle background to elicit distinct emotions in the mind of an audiovisual production’s audience.</li><li>Music can play a vital influence in the success of a video. The soundtrack can keep the viewer interested in the clip if the video itself is not entertaining.</li></ul><p><strong>How Can I Utilise Music Lawfully In My Youtube Videos?</strong></p><p>If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you’ll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube’s music policy comes into play.</p><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?"></a>How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</h2><p>At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness.

You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music.

According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it’s a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube’s new 2 GB size restriction.</p><h4 id="What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube-3"><a href="#What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?"></a>What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?</h4><ul><li>YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.</li><li>Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.</li><li>Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to. It also allows for the creation of a unique ambiance with a more or less subtle background to elicit distinct emotions in the mind of an audiovisual production’s audience.</li><li>Music can play a vital influence in the success of a video. The soundtrack can keep the viewer interested in the clip if the video itself is not entertaining.</li></ul><p><strong>How Can I Utilise Music Lawfully In My Youtube Videos?</strong></p><p>If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you’ll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube’s music policy comes into play.</p><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?"></a>How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</h2><p>At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?"></a>Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?</h4><p>YouTube’s music library is relatively small. The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you’re adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you’ve ever wondered. On the surface, posting songs to YouTube may appear complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it’ll be a snap. When considering how to promote your music, YouTube should not be disregarded. It’s rare to have a free platform to distribute music on, so make use of it. With such a massive YouTube user base, your potential audience is enormous. Get your song on the platform and promote it as much as possible. You never know who might come upon your tunes until you’ve made them public. This concluded the tutorial on how to upload music to YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-how-does-youtube-work-after-a-video-is-uploaded/"><u>[Updated] How Does YouTube Work After a Video Is Uploaded</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ips-for-youtube-video-shooting/"><u>[New] Tips for YouTube Video Shooting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-transforming-your-spotify-list-into-a-youtube-music-collection/"><u>In 2024, Transforming Your Spotify List Into a YouTube Music Collection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-unveiling-the-finest-9-free-youtube-brand-tools-online/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unveiling the Finest 9 Free YouTube Brand Tools Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/approved-simplified-customization-for-your-youtube-channel-url/"><u>2024 Approved  Simplified Customization for Your YouTube Channel URL</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ades-across-platforms-for-video-creators/"><u>Accolades Across Platforms for Video Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/onvert-your-streaming-top-free-video-to-audio-tools/"><u>[New] Convert Your Streaming  Top Free Video to Audio Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/cket-views-on-youtube-in-minutes-2-strategies/"><u>Skyrocket Views on YouTube in Minutes (2 Strategies)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ideo-growth-booster-top-seo-tools-uncovered-for-2024/"><u>[New] Video Growth Booster – Top SEO Tools Uncovered for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-dynamic-descriptor-constructor-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Dynamic Descriptor Constructor for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-innovations-in-capturing-high-quality-facetime-calls/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Innovations in Capturing High-Quality FaceTime Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-eye-on-the-screen-youtube-journey-comparison-from-creator-to-competitor/"><u>[Updated] Eye on the Screen  YouTube Journey Comparison From Creator to Competitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/mobile-filming-tools-for-tourists/"><u>Mobile Filming Tools for Tourists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/possible-ways-to-recover-deleted-files-from-x5-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>Possible ways to recover deleted files from X5 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-audiophiles-choice-for-mac-recording-top-5-software-scooped-up-for-2024/"><u>[New] Audiophile's Choice for Mac Recording  Top 5 Software Scooped Up for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-the-role-of-timestamps-in-content-longevity-and-popularity/"><u>[New] The Role of Timestamps in Content Longevity and Popularity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/enabling-personal-media-storage-for-tv-shows-for-2024/"><u>Enabling Personal Media Storage for TV Shows for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-resolving-social-media-puzzle-zippy-fb-videos-not-in-view/"><u>[New] In 2024, Resolving Social Media Puzzle  Zippy FB Videos Not in View</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-speech-synthesis-simplified-transforming-ssaxml-into-srt-perfection/"><u>In 2024, Speech Synthesis Simplified  Transforming SSA/XML Into SRT Perfection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/top-tier-digital-workshop-title-maker-for-2024/"><u>Top-Tier Digital Workshop Title Maker for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

With such a large community of music listeners on YouTube, many well-known and lesser-known musicians continue to upload their songs regularly. If you’re a music producer, you’ll probably want to do this as well. However, understanding how to upload music to YouTube might be difficult, so this article is created to assist you.</p><p>When you upload a song to YouTube, it becomes available to the entire globe. Unlike other streaming services, anyone can use YouTube for free. This is a one-of-a-kind platform for sharing music. This is an opportunity that every artist should take advantage of, with a potential audience of billions.</p><p>So, how do you go about uploading songs to YouTube? Regular file formats aren’t applicable; therefore, this is the only challenging component. YouTube does not recognize.mp3 or.mp4 files, which makes things a little more difficult for the average producer. It’s simple to get around this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-music-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="how to upload music to youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Details On Youtube Music</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</a></p><h2 id="Details-On-Youtube-Music-3"><a href="#Details-On-Youtube-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="Details On Youtube Music"></a>Details On Youtube Music</h2><p>YouTube recently added ‘YouTube Music’ to assist advertise the website as a music-focused destination. You don’t have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don’t want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube’s music.</p><p>Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.</p><p>Even though this is critical for compensating artists, it already restricts the audience’s reach. Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don’t have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn’t have any of these problems.</p><p>YouTube’s other services are also free, making them accessible to everybody regardless of their financial position. This implies that you can access the site as long as you have a phone or a laptop. Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site’s potential for musical promotion.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube-3"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?"></a>Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</h2><p>YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.</p><h4 id="Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit-3"><a href="#Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit-3" class="headerlink" title="Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit"></a>Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit</h4><p>The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube’s blog and Google’s 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it’s a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube’s new 2 GB size restriction.</p><h4 id="What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube-3"><a href="#What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?"></a>What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?</h4><ul><li>YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.</li><li>Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.</li><li>Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to.

Let’s discuss this scenario in detail in this article!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>YouTube’s TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, is now rocking globally. Seeing the success of Instagram Reels and TikTok, it seems like YouTube didn’t want to lag behind the game. So in September last year, it decided to step into short-form content via YouTube Shorts, a social platform for quick 60-second videos hosted on the YouTube app.</p><p>According to the Shorts product lead <strong>Todd Sherman</strong>, the social media giant aims to unleash new grounds for creativity.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok is a short-form, video-sharing app that assists users to share and make 15-second to 60-seconds videos on any topic.</p><p>TikTok contains a separate app for the Chinese market, <strong>Douyin</strong>, with 300 million-plus active monthly users. The new app’s logo is a merger of the Duyin and Musical.ly logos.</p><p>And, we’re going to discuss the comparison of both these giants, i.e., <strong>YouTube</strong> <strong>Shorts vs. TikTok</strong>, in terms of which app is better for making short videos.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?"></a>Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?</h2><p>In general, we can’t say that YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok because YouTube Shorts is YouTube’s expansion and have its own identity than TikTok.</p><p>YouTube Shorts is playing hand in hand with TikTok as the short-form video platform, but the Shorts integration with the broader ecosystem of YouTube is its key selling point according to Google’s service.</p><p>Ironically, while YouTube is laying ways to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. This is why TikTok has tripled its maximum video length to three minutes for everyone and has been developing apps slowly on TV platforms like Fire TV and Android TV.</p><p>At a glance, YouTube Shorts looks pretty similar to TikTok. However, there are certain TikTok features that even the Shorts product manager Todd Sherman disagrees with is that of the YouTube Shorts. Sherman said the way TikTok works is quite an industry-wide standard than the point of view of any single app.</p><p>Even though YouTube is quite late to the short-form content game, it has a strong brand of YouTube behind it.</p><p>Thus, saying that “YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok” doesn’t even qualify in terms of the $100 million fund sanctioned for the creators of YouTube Shorts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?"></a>Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?</h2><p>In this section, we’ve defined the analysis of <strong>YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok</strong> in the form of both a comparison table and specific points of similarities and differences.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Basis of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong></th><th><strong>TikTok</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Video Length&#x2F;Duration</strong></td><td>Up to 60 seconds</td><td>Up to 3 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>9:16</td><td>9:16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video Captions&#x2F;Description</strong></td><td>You can find the video title in the exact location as the TikTok caption, but the description is visible only after users click on the three dots.</td><td>Video captions are located at the bottom left.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Placement of Analytics</strong></td><td>YouTube Studio</td><td>TikTok app itself</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dislike Button</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok"><a href="#Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. The Similarities Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok"></a>Section 1. The Similarities Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>Both these platforms are for short-form video content.</li><li>The TikTok and YouTube Shorts both assist creators in adding music from their audio libraries, and users can view all videos beneath the audio library.</li><li>Both offer analytics, including video views, likes, comments, watch time, shares, impressions, and reach. You can view these analytics on a desktop or mobile device for both platforms.</li><li>The Shorts and TikTok feed provide a full-screen immersive experience with the engagement menu shown on the right-hand panel.</li><li>Their feeds scroll in the same manner. Plus, there is an endless number of videos lined up for users to discover and watch. Yet, there’s no auto-scroll on either, and users must scroll manually for the following video to come up.</li><li>Both provide tools that assist creators in earning money from their content creation.</li><li>Users can subscribe or follow creators directly from their videos in both feeds.</li><li>Both offer creators the ability to alter their video content’s speed and help them to set timers with the filming process.</li><li>YouTube Shorts TikTok give creators the ability to upload video content they’ve previously filmed.</li><li>You can add closed captions and overlaying text to both of these platforms.</li><li>They both assist creators in setting a video for the public, so anyone can view it or set it to private.</li></ul><h3 id="Section-2-The-Differences-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok"><a href="#Section-2-The-Differences-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Section 2. The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok"></a>Section 2. The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>The monetization features of both these platforms are entirely different. Shorts offer their ‘Shorts fund,’ whereas TikTok provides Shoutouts and Digital Gifts.</li><li>Shorts can only be 60-seconds long, whereas TikTok’s can be as long as three minutes (it could soon be stretched to five minutes duration as per their recent test).</li><li>TikTok allows users to add video captions that are present in the bottom left area of TikTok. At the same time, users can add a video title in Shorts which is present in the exact location as a TikTok caption. And, a video description that is only viewable when users click the three dots above the link button and click ‘Description’ can be in YouTube Shorts.</li><li>YouTube has a large music library which gives users an abundance of undiscovered and popular songs to select from, possibly more than the TikTok offerings list.</li><li>TikTok has a vast library of filters, including greenscreen and AR effects, whereas Shorts only provides filters that edit the video’s tone, temperature, brightness, etc.</li><li>Shorts’ ‘private’ video option allows creators to choose or see who watches your video. On the other hand, TikTok’s ‘private’ video option only allows the creator to view the video.</li><li>You can view the TikTok analytics directly in the TikTok app. On the other hand, YouTube Shorts analytics can be visible in YouTube Studio.</li></ul><h3 id="Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…"><a href="#Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…" class="headerlink" title="Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…"></a>Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…</h3><ul><li>A stitch and duet feature, where users can add other creators’ videos to their accounts.</li><li>A Q&amp;A feature to leave questions for creators to answer with a video.

Or if they’d like to restrict their videos to viewers under 18.</li><li>You can edit even after publishing.</li><li>The option to “unlist” your Shorts, which means anyone can view it with a link to that video.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-Which-One-Is-Better-for-Short-Video-Promotion"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-Which-One-Is-Better-for-Short-Video-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better for Short Video Promotion"></a>Part 3: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better for Short Video Promotion</h2><p>One of the differences that may determine the success of YouTube Shorts is that it is not a traditional social media app. While TikTok entices users to create, watch, and even share videos with friends within the app, the YouTube Shorts format is pretty different from TikTok.</p><p>Since YouTube doesn’t have this simple method of direct messaging and isn’t wholly dependent on creating, sharing, and watching Shorts, it looks that it may have a hard time keeping up with TikTok’s success.</p><p>Another drawback of YouTube Shorts in comparing <strong>YouTube Shorts vs.</strong> <strong>TikTok</strong> is that Shorts isn’t available through a dedicated app like TikTok. Thus, even though it keeps up the promise of creating, watching, and sharing both long and short-form content, it may turn away those who prefer focused access to quick content. Regardless, with YouTube Shorts now starting to become available to more users, the battle in the viral video market with TikTok is sure to heat up.</p><p>Before giving you our opinion on which is the better platform for short video promotion, go through the following conversation first.</p><p>Ramona Pringle is an associate professor and a tech expert at Toronto’s Ryerson University. She said in an interview that because YouTube already has figured out video content, the transformation to add short-form video will be natural.</p><p>She also mentioned that YouTube Shorts is the platform best placed with the competition from TikTok than all other platforms. However, YouTube doesn’t need to be TikTok as it has its strategies and broad audience base.</p><p>Like Pringle, Matt Navarra, a social media consultant based in the U.K., said in an interview that Shorts is a logical evolution and extension of YouTube, which has further given rise to TikTok. But unlike TikTok, Shorts has a few features that it can take benefit from. Among these features is the extensive audio library content, the greater scope for users to remix and create duets and stuff from scratch. Undoubtedly, you can’t deny the experience of YouTube in terms of access to partnerships with the music industry and licensing.</p><p>Thus, keeping all these factors in mind, we’d like to conclude that both the YouTube Shorts and TikTok are great and considerable platforms for short video promotion. Still, we’d like to place YouTube Shorts in the upper place due to its global availability. Whereas TikTok is already banned in certain countries.</p><p>It also depends upon the audience base of the country as to which platform is in use the most. Suppose it’s TikTok that people primarily use in a particular country or location where the brand wants to advertise itself.
